Statements\n\n(Unaudited)\n\n## 1.    Description of Business\n\nStitch Fix, Inc. ('we,' 'our,' 'us,' or 'the Company') delivers personalization to our clients through the pairing of data science and human judgment. Currently, clients can engage with us in one of two ways that, combined, form an ecosystem of personalized experiences across styling, shopping, and inspiration: (1) by receiving a personalized shipment of items informed by our algorithms and sent by a Stitch Fix stylist (a 'Fix'); or (2) by purchasing directly  from  our  website  or  mobile  app  based  on  a  personalized  assortment  of  outfit  and  item  recommendations  ('Freestyle').  Clients  can  choose  to schedule automatic shipments or order a Fix on demand after they fill out a style profile on our website or mobile app. After receiving a Fix, our clients purchase the items they want to keep and return the other items, if any. Freestyle utilizes our algorithms to recommend a personalized assortment of outfit and item recommendations that will update throughout the day and will continue to evolve as we learn more about the client. We are incorporated in Delaware and have operations in the United States. Previously, we also had operations in the United Kingdom ('UK'). During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the requirements to report the UK business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\n\n## 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nOur fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to July 31. The fiscal year ending August 3, 2024 ('fiscal 2024') consists of 53 weeks, with the extra week occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter ending August 3, 2024. The fiscal year ended July 29, 2023 ('fiscal 2023') consisted of 52 weeks.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stitch Fix, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') and the applicable rules and regulations of the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ('SEC')  for  interim  financial  information.  As  permitted  under  those  rules,  certain  footnotes  or  other financial information that are normally required by GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for the fair  statement  of  our  financial  information.  These  interim  results  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  results  to  be  expected  for  the  fiscal  year  ending August  3,  2024,  or  for  any  other  interim  period  or  for  any  other  future  year.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 29, 2023 (the '2023 Annual Report').\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the accounting requirements for reporting the UK business as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of the UK business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the Company's continuing operations. Refer to Note 12, 'Discontinued Operations' for further details.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are used for inventory, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nUnless noted below, there have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, as described in our fiscal 2023 Annual Report, that had a material impact on these condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\n\n## Short-Term Investments\n\nOur  short-term  investments  have  been  classified  and  accounted  for  as  available-for-sale  securities.  The  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses  on  our available-for-sale debt securities was immaterial at both April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023.\n\nWe have elected  to  present  accrued  interest  receivable  separately  from  short-term  investments  in  the  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Accrued interest  receivable,  which  was  immaterial  at  both  April  27,  2024  and  July  29,  2023,  is  recorded  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  in  the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We did not write off any accrued interest receivable during the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 or April 29, 2023.\n\n## Inventory, net\n\nInventory, net consists of finished goods recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Gross inventory costs include both merchandise costs and in-bound freight costs.\n\nInventory, net includes reserves for excess and slow-moving inventory we expect to write off based on historical trends, damaged inventory, and shrinkage. Our total inventory reserves were $25.7 million and $38.7 million as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. At both April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023,  we  recorded  additional  specific  reserves  related  to  excess  and  slow-moving  seasonal  inventory.  We  have  not  made  any  material  changes  to  our assumptions included in the calculations of the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves at April 27, 2024 or July 29, 2023.\n\n## Leases\n\nOur leasing portfolio consists of operating leases, which include lease arrangements for our corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and, to a lesser extent, equipment. Operating leases with a term greater than one year are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as operating lease right-of-use assets  and  operating  lease  liabilities  at  the  commencement  date.  These  balances  are  initially  recorded  at  the  present  value  of  future  minimum  lease payments, which is calculated using our incremental borrowing rate and the expected lease term. Certain adjustments to our operating lease right-of-use assets may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received.\n\nWe have subleased certain portions of our fulfillment centers and corporate offices due to the reduction in square footage needs for our current operations. Sublease income is recorded as a reduction to rent expense, which is reflected in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. We may continue to seek sublease arrangements for certain corporate office space and fulfillment centers as needed.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the requirements to report the UK business as a discontinued operation. The functional currency of our UK business was the British pound sterling. We translated assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates, and average monthly exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. Prior to being classified as a discontinued operation, we recorded translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ('AOCI') as a component of stockholders' equity. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, historical foreign currency translation losses, which were previously recognized in AOCI, were fully reclassified from equity to loss from discontinued  operations,  net  of  income  taxes  in  the  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive  loss.  Refer  to  Note  7, 'Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)' and Note 12, 'Discontinued Operations' for further details.\n\nNet  foreign  exchange  transaction  gains  and  losses  attributable  to  continuing  operations  resulting  from  the  conversion  of  the  transaction  currency  to functional currency are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe apply fair value accounting for assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe  review  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment charge related to a portion of our corporate office space. Refer to 'Note 11 - Restructuring' for  further  details.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2024,  we  reviewed  our  right-of-use  lease  asset  associated  with  our  San  Francisco  headquarters  for impairment. Refer to 'Note 13 - Subsequent Events' for further details.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of merchandise to clients in a Fix and when clients purchase merchandise directly from Freestyle. Clients create an online account on our website or mobile app, complete a style profile, and order a Fix or merchandise to be delivered on a specified date.\n\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the client. For a Fix, control is transferred when the client accepts or rejects the offer to purchase merchandise. Upon acceptance by purchasing one or more items within the Fix at checkout, the total amount of the order, including the upfront styling fee, is recognized as revenue. If none of the items within the Fix are accepted at checkout, the upfront styling fee is recognized as revenue at that time. The Style Pass annual fee is recognized at the earlier of (i) the time at which a client accepts and applies the Style Pass fee to an offer to purchase merchandise or (ii) upon expiry of the annual period. Under Style Pass arrangements, if a client does not accept any items within the Fix, the annual fee will continue to be deferred until it is applied to a future purchase or upon expiry of the annual period. If a client would like to exchange an item, we recognize revenue at the time the exchanged item is shipped, which coincides with the transfer of control to the customer. For a Freestyle purchase, control is transferred and revenue is recognized upon shipment to the client.\n\nWe deduct discounts, sales tax, and estimated refunds to arrive at net revenue. Sales tax collected from clients is not considered revenue and is included in accrued liabilities until remitted to the taxing authorities. Our refund reserve is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe have five types of contractual liabilities: (i) cash collections of upfront styling fees, which are included in deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of application to a merchandise purchase or expiry of the offer, (ii) cash collections of Style Pass annual fees, which are included in deferred revenue and are recognized upon the earlier of application to a merchandise purchase or expiry of the Style Pass annual period, (iii) unredeemed gift cards, which are included in gift card liability and recognized as revenue upon usage or inclusion in gift card breakage estimates, (iv) referral credits, which are included in other current liabilities and are recognized as revenue when used, and (v) cash collections of Freestyle purchases, which are included in deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon shipment.\n\nWe expect deferred revenue for upfront styling fees, Freestyle orders, and Style Pass annual fees to be recognized within one year. On average, our gift card liability and other current liabilities are also recognized within one year.\n\nThe following table summarizes the balances of contractual liabilities included in deferred revenue, gift card liability, and other current liabilities as of the dates indicated:\n\n| (in thousands)             | April 27, 2024   | July 29, 2023   |\n|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Deferred revenue:          |                  |                 |\n| Upfront styling fees       | $ 5,392          | $ 6,075         |\n| Style Pass annual fees     | 3,991            | 4,521           |\n| Freestyle orders           | 945              | 770             |\n| Total deferred revenue     | $ 10,328         | $ 11,366        |\n| Gift card liability        | $ 10,013         | $ 10,328        |\n| Other current liabilities: |                  |                 |\n| Referral credits           | $ 494            | $ 362           |\n\nThe following table summarizes revenue recognized during the nine months ended April 27, 2024, that was previously included in deferred revenue, gift card liability, and other current liabilities at July 29, 2023:\n\n| (in thousands)         | Revenue Recognized From Amounts Previously Included in Deferred Balances at July 29, 2023   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Upfront styling fees   | 6,054                                                                                       |\n| Style Pass annual fees | 3,677                                                                                       |\n| Freestyle orders       | 554                                                                                         |\n| Gift card liability    | 1,838                                                                                       |\n| Referral credits       | 116                                                                                         |\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risks\n\nWe are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally from cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. The majority of our cash is held by one  financial  institution  within  the  United  States.  Our  cash  balance  held  by  this  institution  exceeds  federally  insured  limits.  The  associated  risk  of concentration for cash is mitigated by banking with credit-worthy institutions. The associated risk of concentration for cash equivalents and investments is mitigated by maintaining a diversified portfolio of highly rated instruments.\n\nNo client accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue, net for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 or April 29, 2023.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment  Disclosures ('ASU  2023-07).  This  update  is  designed  to  improve  reportable  segment  disclosure  requirements,  primarily  through  enhanced disclosures  about  significant  segment  expenses.  This  standard  also  enhances  interim  disclosure  requirements  and  provides  new  segment  disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. This standard is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2025 for the annual period, and the interim periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\n\nIn  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (\"ASU\")  No.  2023-09, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax Disclosures ('ASU 2023-09'). This update enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by improving the income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This standard is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2026 with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\n\n## 3.    Fair Value Measurements\n\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. At April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, the carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximated fair value due to their short-term nature. We measure our  cash  equivalents  and  investments  at  fair  value  within  Level  1  or  Level  2  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  because  we  value  these  investments  using unadjusted, quoted market prices; or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs, respectively.\n\nOur cash equivalents and investments accounted for as available-for-sale securities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                          | April 27, 2024   | April 27, 2024   | April 27, 2024   | April 27, 2024   | July 29, 2023   | July 29, 2023   | July 29, 2023   | July 29, 2023   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in thousands)           | Level 1          | Level 2          | Level 3          | Total            | Level 1         | Level 2         | Level 3         | Total           |\n| Cash equivalents:        |                  |                  |                  |                  |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Money market funds       | $ 89,471         | $ -

We evaluate securities for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis with consideration given to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether we intend to sell the securities, and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As of April 27, 2024, the losses on our available-for-sale securities were immaterial. We have the current intent and ability to retain these securities until maturity or recovery of the amortized cost basis. Therefore, expected credit losses as of April 27, 2024 were immaterial.\n\nThe fair values of available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity as of April 27, 2024 were as follows:\n\n|                          | April 27, 2024   | April 27, 2024                   | April 27, 2024   | April 27, 2024   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in thousands)           | One Year or Less | Over One Year Through Five Years | Over Five Years  | Total            |\n| Investments:             |                  |                                  |                  |                  |\n| U.S. Treasury securities | $ 7,458          | $ -                              | $ -              | $ 7,458          |\n| Corporate bonds          | 40,540           | -                                | -                | 40,540           |\n| Total                    | $ 47,998         | $ -                              | $ -              | $ 47,998         |\n\n## 4.

Credit Facility\n\nPrior to December 4, 2023, we were party to an amended and restated credit agreement, entered into June 2, 2021 and amended on July 29, 2022 (the 'Amended Credit  Agreement')  with  Silicon  Valley  Bank,  a  division  of  First-Citizens  Bank  &amp;  Trust  Company  (successor  by  purchase  to  the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver for Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. (as successor of Silicon Valley Bank)), and other lenders, to provide a revolving line of credit of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate amount of $30.0 million, and a swingline subfacility in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million.\n\nOn December 4, 2023, we entered into a first lien credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as agent and lender, which provides for a $50.0 million revolving credit facility maturing on December 4, 2026 (the '2023 Credit Facility'). Upon entry into the 2023 Credit Facility, the Amended Credit Agreement was terminated.  The  2023  Credit  Facility  includes  a  sub-facility  that  provides  for  the  issuance  of  letters  of  credit  in  an  amount  of  up  to  $30.0  million. Availability of the 2023 Credit Facility will be based upon a borrowing base formula and periodic borrowing base certifications valuing certain of our accounts receivable, credit card receivables, and inventory as reduced by certain reserves, if any. Our borrowing availability as of April 27, 2024 was $50.0 million, and our borrowing capacity was $29.4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit, and no outstanding borrowing.\n\nThe 2023 Credit Facility is subject to customary fees for loan facilities of this type, including a commitment fee equal to 0.30% based on the average daily undrawn portion of the 2023 Credit Facility, payable quarterly.\n\nThe interest rate applicable to the 2023 Credit Facility will be, at our option, either (a) the Adjusted Term SOFR rate for the applicable interest period (subject to a 0.00% floor), plus a margin of 2.00% or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin of 2.00%. The Base Rate is the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the Wall Street Journal prime rate and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%.\n\nDebt under the 2023 Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and such subsidiaries' assets. The 2023 Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, indemnification provisions, and events of default. The 2023 Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum liquidity level and, if applicable, a minimum total consolidated fixed  charge  coverage  ratio  during  the  periods  set  forth  in  the  2023  Credit  Facility.  As  of  April  27,  2024,  we  were  in  compliance  with  all  financial covenants.\n\n## 6.    Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. Although we cannot predict with assurance the outcome of any litigation or tax matters,  we  do  not  believe  there  are  currently  any  such  actions  that,  if  resolved  unfavorably,  would  have  a  material  impact  on  our  operating  results, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nOn August 26, 2022, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws was filed by certain of our stockholders in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants us and certain of our officers and directors. An amended complaint was filed on August 15, 2023. The lawsuit alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by us and our officers for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements regarding our Freestyle offering between December 2020 and June 2022. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on November 1, 2023. The plaintiffs filed an Opposition to Motion to Dismiss on December 22, 2023, and the Company filed a Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss on February 6, 2024. A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on April 18, 2024 and the Company is awaiting a decision. .On March 17, 2023, a derivative action was filed against certain former directors in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, based on the same factual allegations underlying the securities class action. It seeks damages and restitution to be paid to the Company by the individual defendants, governance changes, and attorney's fees and costs. The case is stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the securities class action. On May 24, 2024 another derivative action was filed, also in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware. It alleges claims based on the same allegations underlying the securities class action and seeks the disgorgement and redistribution of alleged insider trading profits by the insider trading defendants to stockholders, damages and restitution to be paid to the Company by the individual defendants, governance changes, and attorney's fees and costs.\n\nThere have been no other material changes to our commitments and contingencies disclosed in our fiscal 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  may  provide  indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, directors, officers, and other parties with respect to certain matters. We have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 7.

(1)\n\nDuring  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2024,  we  ceased  operations  of  our  UK  business  and  the  accounting  requirements  for  reporting  the  UK  business  as  a  discontinued  operation  were  met. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we reclassified historical foreign currency translation losses, which were previously recognized in AOCI, from stockholders' equity to loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 2, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' and Note 12, 'Discontinued Operations' for further details. (2)\n\n## 8.    Stock-Based Compensation\n\n## Stock Plans\n\n## 2011 Equity Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the '2011 Plan'). The 2011 Plan provided for the grant of stock-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employees under terms and provisions established by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe 2011 Plan allowed for the grant of incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, as well as restricted stock units ('RSU'), restricted stock awards ('RSA'), and stock appreciation rights. Only incentive and nonqualified stock options were granted under the 2011 Plan. Employee stock option awards generally vested 25% on the first anniversary of the grant date with the remaining shares subject to the option vesting ratably over the next three years subject to the employee's continued service with the Company. Options generally expire after 10 years. Effective upon our initial public offering in 2017, the 2011 Plan was replaced by the 2017 Incentive Plan.\n\n## 2017 Incentive Plan\n\nIn  November  2017,  our  Board  of  Directors  and  stockholders  adopted  our  2017  Incentive  Plan  (the  '2017  Plan').  The  remaining  shares  available  for issuance under our 2011 Plan became reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan. Our 2017 Plan provides for the grant of Class A incentive stock options to employees,  including  employees  of  our  subsidiary,  and  for  the  grant  of  nonqualified  stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  RSAs,  RSU  awards, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of stock awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of our subsidiaries. Employee stock option awards generally begin to vest six months after the grant date with the remaining shares subject to the option vesting ratably over the next thirty months. Options generally expire after 10 years. RSU awards made to employees generally vest ratably on a quarterly basis subject to the employee's continued service with the Company. As of April 27, 2024, the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan was 44,038,883 shares of Class A common stock, and the number of shares available for grant was 3,167,209.\n\n## 2019 Inducement Plan\n\nIn  October  2019,  our  Board  of  Directors  adopted  our  2019  Inducement  Plan  (the  '2019  Plan').  Our  2019  Plan  provides  for  the  grant  of  Class  A nonqualified stock options and RSU awards to individuals who satisfy the standards for inducement grants under the relevant Nasdaq Stock Market rules. As of April 27, 2024, the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan was 10,750,000 shares of Class A common stock and the number of shares available for grant was 630,725.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nStock option activity under the 2011 Plan, 2017 Plan, and 2019 Plan was as follows:\n\n|                           | Options Outstanding   | Options Outstanding              | Options Outstanding                                     | Options Outstanding   | Options Outstanding                      |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                           | Number of Options     | Weighted- Average Exercise Price | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) |                       | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) |\n| Balance at July 29, 2023  | 8,106,110             | $ 7.06                           | 8.78                                                    | $                     | 4,770                                    |\n| Granted                   | 4,191,676             | 3.37                             |                                                         |                       |                                          |\n| Exercised                 | -                     | -                                |                                                         |                       |                                          |\n| Cancelled                 | (1,275,986)           | 7.97                             |                                                         |                       |                                          |\n| Balance at April 27, 2024 | 11,021,800            | $ 5.55                           | 1.74                                                    | $                     | 2                                        |\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nRSU award activity under the 2017 Plan and 2019 Plan was as follows:\n\n|                            | Unvested RSUs        | Unvested RSUs                           |\n|----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                            | Class A Common Stock | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value |\n| Unvested at July 29, 2023  | 11,455,577           | $ 10.47                                 |\n| Granted                    | 13,526,752           | 3.21                                    |\n| Vested                     | (6,718,464)          | 6.73                                    |\n| Forfeited                  | (6,045,683)          | 7.43                                    |\n| Unvested at April 27, 2024 | 12,218,182           | $ 6.00                                  |\n\n## Performance-Based Stock Awards\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company incurred stock-based compensation expense under compensation arrangements with certain of its employees under which the Company settled bonuses for a fixed dollar amount by issuing a variable number of restricted stock units. The awards had both service and performance conditions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company issued 848,489 RSUs based on the Company's trailing seven-day average share price, following the Company's public release of fiscal 2023 financial results. Stock-based compensation expense for these awards was recorded in fiscal 2023.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nStock-based compensation expense for options and RSUs granted to employees was $18.9 million and $59.9 million for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, and $22.0 million and $78.4 million for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023. Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nAs of April 27, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options and RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was $76.4 million, which we expect to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 1.8 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended April 27, 2024, was $2.09 per share. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended April 29, 2023, was $2.93 per share.\n\nWe record stock-based compensation of stock options granted to employees by estimating the fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and amortizing the fair value of the stock-based awards granted over the applicable vesting period of the awards on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options granted to employees was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\n\n|                          | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                          | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Expected term (in years) | 3.7 - 4.0                    | 3.8 - 5.3                    | 3.7 - 5.5                   | 3.2 - 5.5                   |\n| Volatility               | 79.9%                        | 83.2%                        | 77.3% - 79.9%               | 83.2% - 87.3%               |\n| Risk free interest rate  | 4.1%                         | 3.6% - 3.8%                  | 4.1% - 4.8%                 | 3.6% - 4.4%                 |\n| Dividend yield           | -%                           | -%                           | -%                          | -%                          |\n\n## 9.    Income Taxes\n\nThe following table summarizes our effective tax rate from loss from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\n|                                                     | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                      | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Loss from continuing operations before income taxes | $ (21,847)                   | $ (18,289)                   | $ (82,636)                  | $ (129,567)                 |\n| Provision for income taxes                          | 170                          | 132                          | 508                         | 450                         |\n| Effective tax rate                                  | (0.8)%                       | (0.7)%                       | (0.6)%                      | (0.4)%                      |\n\nOur continuing operations are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded on our net federal and state deferred tax assets. The tax provision for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 is primarily comprised of state taxes.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded on our net federal and state deferred tax assets.

Net Loss Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Common Stock\n\nBasic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities: Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion, and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the stockholder into one share of Class A common stock.\n\nBasic net loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\n\nFor the calculation of diluted loss per share from continuing operations, net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for basic loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, including all potentially dilutive common shares. In periods of loss, there are no potentially dilutive common shares to add to the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding. The undistributed losses are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the losses for the year have been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed loss is allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders:\n\n|                                                                                                    | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)                                                 | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Numerator:                                                                                         |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders        | $ (22,017)                   | $ (18,421)                   | $ (83,144)                  | $ (130,017)                 |\n| Denominator:                                                                                       |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Weighted-average shares of common stock - basic                                                    | 121,268,047                  | 115,445,285                  | 118,986,077                 | 113,911,089                 |\n| Weighted-average shares of common stock - diluted                                                  | 121,268,047                  | 115,445,285                  | 118,986,077                 | 113,911,089                 |\n| Loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders: |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Basic                                                                                              | $ (0.18)                     | $ (0.16)                     | $ (0.70)                    | $ (1.14)                    |\n| Diluted                                                                                            | $ (0.18)                     | $ (0.16)                     | $ (0.70)                    | $ (1.14)                    |\n\nAs the Company has reported net loss from continuing operations for each of the periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities were considered antidilutive.

The actual timing, number, and value of shares repurchased in the future will be determined by the Company in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements, our capital needs, and whether there is a better alternative use of capital.\n\nWe did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended April 27, 2024 or April 29, 2023. As of April 27, 2024, $120.0 million remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program authorization. Repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program during any given fiscal period will reduce the number of weighted-average common shares outstanding for the respective period.\n\n## 11.    Restructuring\n\nIn June 2022, we announced a restructuring plan (the '2022 Restructuring Plan') to reduce our future fixed and variable operating costs and allow us to centralize key capabilities, strengthen decision-making to drive efficiencies, and ensure we are allocating resources to our most critical priorities.\n\nIn furtherance of and as an expansion of the 2022 Restructuring Plan, in January 2023, we implemented a plan of termination ('January 2023 Reduction in Force'). The January 2023 Reduction in Force reduced our then-current employee workforce by approximately 6%, including approximately 20% of our then-salaried positions. During fiscal 2023, we recorded an aggregate $36.4 million of restructuring charges related to this action, primarily consisting of severance and employee-related benefits; impairment related to a portion of our corporate office space; and accelerated depreciation expense related to assets  at  our  Salt  Lake  City  fulfillment  center,  which  were  not  transferred  to  other  fulfillment  centers  in  our  network  and  for  which  we  did  not  have immediate plans to use.\n\nIn  furtherance  of  and  as  an  expansion  of  the  2022  Restructuring  Plan,  in  June  2023,  we  announced  the  intended  closures  of  our  fulfillment  centers  in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Dallas, Texas (the 'Bethlehem and Dallas Closures'). The Bethlehem, Pennsylvania location ceased operations during the three months ended October 28, 2023, and the Dallas, Texas location ceased operations in the three months ending April 27, 2024. During fiscal 2023, we recorded an aggregate $2.6 million related to this action, primarily consisting of severance and employee-related benefits, and accelerated depreciation expense and other restructuring costs. During the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, we recorded $2.5 million and $16.5 million, respectively, of restructuring  charges  related  to  the  Bethlehem  and  Dallas  closures,  primarily  consisting  of  severance  and  employee-related  benefits,  and  accelerated depreciation expense and other restructuring costs.\n\nIn furtherance of and as an expansion of the 2022 Restructuring Plan, in January 2024, we implemented an organization realignment that resulted in the further elimination of styling leadership and corporate positions. During the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, we recorded $0.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to this action, primarily consisting of severance and employee-related benefits.\n\nIn January 2024, we revised our compensation model for full-time stylists to move to a part-time only model, whereby stylists who will opt to continue with the Company will be paid one-time restructuring bonuses over the next three quarters to continue to serve the Company. During the three and nine months  ended  April  27,  2024,  we  recorded  $1.7  million,  respectively,  related  to  this  action,  primarily  consisting  of  severance  and  employee-related benefits.\n\nThe components of total restructuring charges were as follows:\n\n|                                         | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                          | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Cash restructuring charges:             |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Severance and employee-related benefits | $ 2,834                      | $ 224                        | $ 9,123                     | $ 16,722                    |\n| Other                                   | 499                          | 510                          | 2,304                       | 645                         |\n| Non-cash restructuring charges:         |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Asset impairments (2)                   | -                            | -                            | -                           | 16,874                      |\n| Accelerated depreciation                | 1,493                        | -                            | 8,830                       | 1,755                       |\n| Other                                   | -                            | 925                          | 913                         | 1,157                       |\n| Total restructuring (1)                 | $ 4,826                      | $ 1,659                      | $ 21,170                    | $ 37,153                    |\n\nRecorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Discontinued Operations\n\nIn June 2023, we announced that we would enter a consultation period, in accordance with UK law, to explore exiting the market in the UK. During the first  quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and the accounting requirements for reporting the UK business as a discontinued operation were met. As a result, the UK business is presented in the accompanying condensed financial statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\n\nCash from our UK business is recorded as continuing operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as any cash remaining after the settlement of outstanding liabilities related to the UK business is expected to be repatriated into the U.S.\n\nThe following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, which are summarized separately in the condensed consolidated balance sheets:\n\n| (in thousands)                               | April 27, 2024   | July 29, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Inventory, net                               | $ -              | $ 6,628         |\n| Prepaid expenses and other current assets    | 864              | 2,995           |\n| Current assets, discontinued operations      | 864              | 9,623           |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets          | -                | 1,565           |\n| Other long-term assets                       | 294              | 481             |\n| Long-term assets, discontinued operations    | 294              | 2,046           |\n| Total assets, discontinued operations        | $ 1,158          | $ 11,669        |\n| Accounts payable                             | $ -              | $ 2,586         |\n| Operating lease liabilities                  | -                | 1,132           |\n| Accrued liabilities                          | 138              | 8,903           |\n| Other current liabilities                    | -                | 161             |\n| Current liabilities, discontinued operations | 138              | 12,782          |\n| Total liabilities, discontinued operations   | $ 138            | $ 12,782        |\n\nThe key components of loss from discontinued operations were as follows:\n\n|                                                                 | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                                  | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Revenue, net                                                    | $ -                          | $ 11,495                     | $ 9,382                     | $ 34,843                    |\n| Cost of goods sold                                              | (482)                        | 7,268                        | 6,792                       | 20,803                      |\n| Gross profit                                                    | 482                          | 4,227                        | 2,590                       | 14,040                      |\n| Selling, general, and administrative expenses                   | (110)                        | 8,456                        | 11,525                      | 28,290                      |\n| Operating income (loss)                                         | 592                          | (4,229)                      | (8,935)                     | (14,250)                    |\n| Interest income                                                 | -                            | 176                          | 187                         | 274                         |\n| Other income (expense), net (1)                                 | 299                          | 891                          | (284)                       | 1,098                       |\n| Income (loss) before income taxes                               | 891                          | (3,162)                      | (9,032)                     | (12,878)                    |\n| Provision (benefit) for income taxes                            | 202                          | 242                          | 166                         | 419                         |\n| Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes | $ 689                        | $ (3,404)                    | $ (9,198)                   | $ (13,297)                  |\n\nFor the nine months ended April 27, 2024, Other income (expense), net includes the loss from the release of historical foreign currency translation adjustments related to the exit of the UK business in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Refer to Note 2, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' for further details. (1)\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we recorded an aggregate $4.7 million of expenses related to the exit and wind down of the UK business, primarily consisting of losses from firm purchase commitments for future receipts of inventory, inventory write-downs to net realizable value, and fixed asset impairment charges. These charges were recorded in both cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses from discontinued operations.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, we recorded an immaterial amount and $5.2 million of expense associated with the exit of the UK business, which consisted primarily of severance and employee-related benefits, and early contract termination charges. These charges were recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses from discontinued operations. We expect future expenses associated with the exit of the UK business to be immaterial.\n\n## 13.    Subsequent Event\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we reviewed our right-of-use lease asset associated with our San Francisco headquarters for impairment due to our intended change in use of the space. Based on the preliminary analysis completed to date, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge in the range of $15 million to $20 million during the three months ending August 3, 2024 to reduce the carrying value of the operating lease right-of-use asset to its estimated fair market value.\n\n## ITEM 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nYou  should  read  the  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  together  with  our  unaudited  condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related  notes  and  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  (the  '2023  Annual  Report')  for  the  year  ended  July  29,  2023,  filed  with  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2023. We use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday that is closest to July 31 of that year. The fiscal year ending August 3, 2024 ('fiscal 2024') consists of 53 weeks, and the fiscal year ended July 29, 2023 ('fiscal 2023') consisted of 52 weeks. Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this 'Quarterly Report'), all references to quarters and years are to our fiscal quarters and fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis  Quarterly  Report  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  involve  risks,  uncertainties,  and  assumptions  that,  if  they  never  materialize  or  prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not purely historical, including without limitation statements in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results  of  operations  regarding  our  projected  financial  position  and  results,  business  strategy,  plans,  and  objectives  of  our  management  for  future operations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act'), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as, but not limited to, 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'could,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'may,' 'might,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'seek,' 'should,' 'target,' 'will,' 'would,' and similar expressions or variations intended to identify forward-looking  statements.  These  statements  are  based  on  the  beliefs  and  assumptions  of  our  management,  which  are  in  turn  based  on  information currently available to management. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled 'Risk Factors' included under Part II, Item 1A below.  Furthermore,  such  forward-looking  statements  speak  only  as  of  the  date  of  this  Quarterly  Report.  Except  as  required  by  law,  we  undertake  no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nSince our founding in 2011, we have helped millions of women, men, and kids discover and buy what they love through personalized shipments of apparel, shoes, and accessories. Currently, clients can engage with us in one of two ways that, combined, form an ecosystem of personalized experiences across styling, shopping, and inspiration: (1) by receiving a personalized shipment of items informed by our algorithms and sent by a Stitch Fix stylist (a 'Fix'); or (2) by purchasing directly from our website or mobile app based on a personalized assortment of outfit and item recommendations ('Freestyle'). For a Fix, clients can choose to schedule automatic shipments or order on demand after they fill out a style profile on our website or mobile app. After receiving a Fix, our clients purchase the items they want to keep and return the other items, if any. Freestyle utilizes our algorithms to recommend a personalized assortment of outfits and items that will update throughout the day and will continue to evolve as we learn more about the client.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nDuring the first  quarter  of  fiscal  2024,  we  ceased  operations  of  our  UK  business  and  the  accounting  requirements  for  reporting  the  UK  business  as  a discontinued operation were met. Accordingly, any discussion of historical information in Management's Discussion and Analysis below reflect the results of  the  UK  business  as  a  discontinued  operation,  and,  amounts  and  disclosures  below  relate  to  the  Company's  continuing  operations  for  all  periods presented, unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 12, 'Discontinued Operations' within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.\n\n## Financial Overview\n\nFor the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, we reported $322.7 million and $1,017.9 million in net revenue, representing a year-over-year decline of  15.8%  and  17.1%,  respectively,  compared  to  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  April  29,  2023.  As  of  April  27,  2024  and  April  29,  2023,  we  had 2,633,000 and 3,288,000 active clients, respectively, representing a year-over-year decline of 19.9%.\n\nDuring  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  April  27,  2024,  we  experienced  a  decline  in  net  revenue  year-over-year  primarily  due  to  our  challenges  in acquiring and retaining clients. We expect these challenges in acquiring and retaining active clients to continue having a negative compounding effect on net revenue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025.\n\nWe remain focused on retaining current clients, improving the conversion of new clients, and enhancing our overall client experience for new and existing clients.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 was $22.0 million and $83.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $18.4 million and $130.0 million for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023.\n\nFor more information on the components of net loss from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, refer to the section titled 'Results of Operations' below.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, in furtherance of and as an expansion of the restructuring plan announced in June 2022 (the '2022 Restructuring Plan'), we recorded $4.8 million and $21.2 million of additional restructuring charges. Related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and stylist compensation restructuring, we estimate we will incur between $1.0 million and $1.5 million of additional cash restructuring charges in the next two fiscal quarters, with substantially all of the cash payments to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nRefer to Note 11, 'Restructuring' within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details of restructuring actions taken.\n\nAdditionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we reviewed our right-of-use lease asset associated with our San Francisco headquarters for impairment due to our intended change in use of the space. Based on the preliminary analysis completed to date, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge in the range of $15 million to $20 million during the three months ending August 3, 2024 to reduce the carrying value of the operating lease right-of-use asset to its estimated fair market value.\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate other fixed and variable operating costs, including further rationalizing our real estate footprint and continuing to optimize and be disciplined in our marketing strategy to better position ourselves for profitability. However, our future results of operations will depend on our ability to successfully navigate current business challenges and the overall macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Key Financial and Operating Metrics\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations ('Adjusted EBITDA') is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that this supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between continuing operations of companies. We believe free cash flow from continuing operations ('Free Cash Flow') is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash from continuing operations we have available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of our non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the closest comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations include:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest income and net other (income) expense as these items are not components of our core business;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our provision for income taxes, which may increase or decrease cash available to us;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted  EBITDA excludes the  non-cash  expense  of  stock-based  compensation,  which  has  been,  and  will  continue  to  be  for  the  foreseeable future, an important part of how we attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA excludes costs incurred related to discrete restructuring plans and other one-time costs attributable to our continuing operations that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time, however these costs do include cash outflows; and\n\n- \u00b7 Free Cash Flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from continuing operations excluding interest income, net other (income) expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring and other one-time costs related to our continuing operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n\n|                                            | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                             | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Net loss from continuing operations        | $ (22,017)                   | (18,421)                     | $ (83,144)                  | $ (130,017)                 |\n| Add (deduct):                              |                              |                              |                             |                             |\n| Interest income                            | (3,002)                      | (2,434)                      | (7,923)                     | (3,814)                     |\n| Other (income) expense, net                | 9                            | 203                          | (980)                       | 1,043                       |\n| Provision for income taxes                 | 170                          | 132                          | 508                         | 450                         |\n| Depreciation and amortization (1)          | 8,443                        | 9,654                        | 27,283                      | 28,742                      |\n| Stock-based compensation expense           | 18,944                       | 22,032                       | 59,911                      | 78,423                      |\n| Restructuring and other one-time costs (2) | 4,134                        | 2,080                        | 24,103                      | 42,977                      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                            | $ 6,681                      | 13,246                       | $ 19,758                    | $ 17,804                    |\n\nFor the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, depreciation and amortization excluded $1.6 million and $9.2 million reflected in 'Restructuring and other one-time costs.'

(2)\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, reduced by purchases of property and equipment that are included in cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Free Cash Flow for each of the periods presented:\n\n|                                                                                | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                                                 | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Free Cash Flow reconciliation:                                                 |                             |                             |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations           | $ 20,007                    | $ 50,680                    |\n| Deduct:                                                                        |                             |                             |\n| Purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations                 | (10,259)                    | (14,864)                    |\n| Free Cash Flow                                                                 | $ 9,748                     | $ 35,816                    |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations | $ (39,549)                  | $ 36,300                    |\n| Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations               | $ (11,817)                  | $ (10,383)                  |\n\n## Operating Metrics\n\n| (in thousands)   | April 27, 2024   | January 27, 2024   | October 28, 2023   | July 29, 2023   | April 29, 2023   |\n|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Active clients   | 2,633            | 2,805              | 2,989              | 3,121           | 3,288            |\n\n## Active Clients\n\nWe believe that the number of active clients is a key indicator of our growth and the overall health of our business. We define an active client as a client who checked out a Fix or was shipped an item via Freestyle in the preceding 52 weeks, measured as of the last day of that period. A client checks out a Fix when she indicates what items she is keeping through our mobile application or on our website. We consider each Women's, Men's, or Kids account as a client,  even  if  they  share  the  same  household.  We  had  2,633,000  and  3,288,000  active  clients  as  of  April  27,  2024  and  April  29,  2023,  respectively, representing a year-over-year decline of 19.9%. The decline in active clients is due to dormant clients outpacing new client additions during the quarter, which we largely attribute to client conversion and retention challenges.\n\n## Net Revenue per Active Client\n\nWe believe that net revenue per active client is an indicator of client engagement and satisfaction. We calculate net revenue per active client based on net revenue over the preceding four fiscal quarters divided by the number of active clients, measured as of the last day of the period. Net revenue per active client was $525 and $516 as of April 27, 2024, and April 29, 2023, respectively, or an increase of 1.7% year over year.\n\n## Factors Affecting Our Performance\n\n## Macroeconomic Environment\n\nOur business and operating results are subject to national and global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. As the macroeconomic  environment  is  experiencing  inflation,  rising  interest  rates,  recessionary  concerns,  tightening  labor  markets,  and  general  uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen or what impact such circumstances could have on our business.\n\n## Inventory Management\n\nWe  leverage  our  data  science  to  buy  and  manage  our  inventory,  including  merchandise  assortment  and  fulfillment  center  optimization.  Because  our merchandise assortment directly correlates to client success, we may at times optimize our inventory to prioritize long-term client success over short-term gross  margin  impact.  To  ensure  sufficient  availability  of  merchandise,  we  generally  enter  into  purchase  orders  well  in  advance  and  frequently  before apparel trends are confirmed by client purchases. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and availability of merchandise at the time of purchase.  We  incur  inventory  write-offs  and  changes  in  inventory  reserves  that  impact  our  gross  margins.  Moreover,  our  inventory  investments  will fluctuate with the needs of our business.\n\n## Client Acquisition and Engagement\n\nTo grow our business, we must continue to acquire clients and successfully engage and retain them. Our marketing strategy aims to preserve liquidity and achieve profitability, while simultaneously attracting long-term customers to fuel a return to growth. We utilize both digital and offline channels to attract new visitors to our website or mobile app and subsequently convert them into clients. Our marketing costs are largely composed of advertising, client referrals, and public relations expenses. At any given time, our advertising efforts may include social media marketing, keyword search campaigns, affiliate programs, partnerships, campaigns with celebrities and influencers, display advertising, television, radio, video, content, direct mail, email, mobile 'push' communications, SMS, and search engine optimization. Our marketing expenses have varied from period to period and we expect this trend to continue.\n\nMarketing expense is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The  largest  component of our marketing expense is advertising, which was $28.6 million and $82.5 million for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, and $26.8 million and $86.6 million for the three and nine months ended and April 29, 2023, respectively. We expect advertising expense to approximate  9%  to  10%  of  revenue  in  the  fourth  quarter  ended  August  3,  2024,  respectively;  however,  we  will  continue  to  be  methodical  about  our approach when we are making advertising decisions, and may adjust our spending up or down based on performance.\n\n## Operations and Infrastructure\n\nWe intend to leverage our data science and deep understanding of our clients' needs to make targeted investments in technology and product, and we plan to prioritize investments with near-term positive returns. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we decided to close our Salt Lake City fulfillment center in order to optimize network capacity. In June 2023, we announced the intended closures of our fulfillment centers in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Dallas, Texas. The Bethlehem, Pennsylvania location ceased operations during the three months ended October 28, 2023 and the Dallas, Texas location ceased operations  in  the  three  months  ended  April  27,  2024.  Refer  to  Note  11,  'Restructuring'  within  the  Notes  to  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.\n\n## Merchandise Mix\n\nWe  offer  apparel,  shoes,  and  accessories  across  categories,  brands,  product  types,  and  price  points.  We  currently  serve  our  clients  in  the  following categories: Women's, Petite, Maternity, Men's, Plus, and Kids. We carry a mix of third-party branded merchandise, including premium brands, and our own Owned Private Label Brands. We also offer a wide variety of product types, including denim, dresses, blouses, skirts, shoes, jewelry, and handbags. We sell merchandise across a broad range of price points and may further broaden our price point offerings in the future.\n\nHistorically, changes in our merchandise mix have not caused significant fluctuations in our gross margin; however, categories, brands, product types, and price points do have a range of margin profiles. For example, our Owned Private Label Brands have\n\ngenerally contributed higher margins than our third-party brands, which have generally contributed lower margins. We continue to evolve our merchandise mix to improve the client experience and attract new active clients. Shifts in merchandise mix will result in fluctuations in our gross margin from period to period.\n\n## Components of Results of Operations\n\n## Revenue\n\nWe generate revenue from the sale of merchandise through our Fix and Freestyle offerings. With our Fix offering, we charge a nonrefundable upfront fee, referred to as a 'styling fee,' that is credited towards any merchandise purchased. We offer Style Pass to provide select U.S. clients with an alternative to paying a styling fee per Fix. Style Pass clients pay a nonrefundable annual fee for unlimited styling that is credited towards merchandise purchases. We deduct  discounts,  sales  tax,  and  estimated  refunds  to  arrive  at  net  revenue,  which  we  refer  to  as  revenue  throughout  this  Quarterly  Report.  We  also recognize revenue resulting from estimated breakage income on gift cards.\n\n## Cost of Goods Sold\n\nCost of goods sold consists of the costs of merchandise, expenses for inbound freight and shipping to and from clients, inventory write-offs and changes in our inventory reserve, payment processing fees, and packaging materials costs, offset by the recoverable cost of merchandise estimated to be returned. We expect  our  cost  of  goods  sold  to  fluctuate  as  a  percentage  of  revenue  primarily  due  to  how  we  manage  our  inventory  and  merchandise  mix.  Our classification of cost of goods sold may vary from other companies in our industry and may not be comparable.\n\n## Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling,  general,  and  administrative  expenses  ('SG&amp;A')  consist  primarily  of  compensation  and  benefits  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation expense, for our employees including our stylists, fulfillment center operations, data analytics, merchandising, engineering, marketing, client experience, and corporate  personnel.  SG&amp;A also includes marketing and advertising costs,  third-party  logistics  costs,  facility  costs  for  our  fulfillment  centers  and offices,  professional  service  fees,  information  technology  costs,  and  depreciation  and  amortization  expense.  As  a  result  of  our  restructuring  and  cost reduction actions throughout fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we expect SG&amp;A in fiscal 2024 to continue to decrease as compared to fiscal 2023. Our classification of certain components within SG&amp;A may vary from other companies in our industry and may not be comparable.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income is generated from our cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities.\n\n## Provision for Income Taxes\n\nOur provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of an estimate of federal and state income taxes based on enacted federal, and state tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, and changes in the valuation of our net federal and state deferred tax assets.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nThe following table summarizes our financial results from continuing operations:\n\n|                                               | For the Three Months

Margin\n\nRevenue  decreased  by  $60.7  million  and  $209.9  million,  or  15.8%  and  17.1%  during  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  April  27,  2024,  respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023. The decrease for both periods was primarily due to a 19.9% decline in active clients from April 29, 2023 to April 27, 2024, which led to a decrease in sales of merchandise. Partially offsetting the revenue decline during the three months ended April 27, 2024, was an improvement in net revenue per active client, which was driven by an increase in the average order value with both average unit retail price and number of items kept by our clients per Fix increasing.\n\nGross margin for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, increased by 280 and 230 basis points, respectively, compared to the same period last year. For both respective periods, the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved product margins and transportation leverage as our carrier mix yielded more favorable rates year over year. For the three months ended April 27, 2024, the increase in gross margin was partially offset by additional inventory reserves.\n\n## Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses\n\nSG&amp;A decreased by $12.4 million and $106.0 million for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended April  29,  2023.  The  year-over-year  decrease  was  primarily  driven  by  our  restructuring  actions,  as  we  realized  lower  year-over-year  compensation  and benefits  expense  including  lower  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  lower  facilities  costs  due  to  the  $16.9  million  non-cash  impairment  charge recorded in the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023. For the three months ended April 27, 2024, the decrease in SG&amp;A was partially offset by an increase in advertising spend. For the nine months ended April 27, 2024, the decrease in SG&amp;A was partially offset by one-time professional service fees.\n\nSG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue increased to 53.2% for both the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, compared with 48.0% and 52.7% for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023, respectively. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, compared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by revenue declining at a faster rate than SG&amp;A.\n\n## Provision for Income Taxes\n\nThe following table summarizes our effective tax rate from loss from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\n|                                                     | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Three Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                      | April 27, 2024               | April 29, 2023               | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Loss from continuing operations before income taxes | (21,847)                     | $ (18,289)                   | $ (82,636)                  | $ (129,567)                 |\n| Provision for income taxes                          | 170                          | 132                          | 508                         | 450                         |\n| Effective tax rate                                  | (0.8)%                       | (0.7)%                       | (0.6)%                      | (0.4)%                      |\n\nOur continuing operations are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded on our net federal and state deferred tax assets. The tax provision for the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 is primarily comprised of state income taxes.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded on our net federal and state deferred tax assets. The tax provision for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2023 is primarily comprised of state income taxes.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Sources of Liquidity\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, investments, cash flows from continuing operations, and borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As of April 27, 2024, we had $196.5 million of cash and cash equivalents attributable to continuing operations, which included $24.7 million held  outside  the  U.S.  in  the  UK,  and  $48.0  million  of  short-term  investments  with  contractual  maturities  of  12  months  or  less.  We  will  use  our  cash balances in the UK to settle the remaining liabilities attributable to our discontinued operations, and we plan to repatriate the remaining UK cash into the U.S. within 12 months of liquidating of the UK entity. This cash repatriation may be subject to taxes and other local statutory restrictions.\n\n## Credit Facility\n\nOn December 4, 2023, we entered into a first lien credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as agent and lender, which provides for a $50.0 million revolving credit facility maturing on December 4, 2026 (the '2023 Credit Facility'). The 2023 Credit Facility includes a sub-facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an amount of up to $30.0 million. Availability of the 2023 Credit Facility will be based upon a borrowing base formula and periodic borrowing base certifications valuing certain of our accounts receivable, credit card receivables, and inventory as reduced by certain reserves, if any. Our borrowing availability as of April 27, 2024 was $50.0 million, and our borrowing capacity was $29.4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit, and no outstanding borrowing.\n\nFor  information  on  the  terms  of  the  2023  Credit  Facility,  refer  to  Note  5,  'Credit  Facility'  within  the  Notes  to  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n\n## Uses of Cash\n\nOur  primary  uses  of  cash  include  operating  costs  such  as  merchandise  purchases,  lease  obligations,  compensation  and  benefits,  marketing,  and  other expenditures necessary to support our business.\n\nWe  believe  our  existing  cash,  cash  equivalents,  investment  balances,  and  the  borrowing  available  under  our  2023  Credit  Facility,  if  needed,  will  be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock, with no expiration date (the '2022 Repurchase Program'). We may repurchase shares from time to time through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased in the future will be determined by the Company in its\n\ndiscretion and will depend on a number of factors, including price, trading volume, market conditions, and other general business conditions. Repurchases will  be  funded  from  the  Company's  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents  or  future  cash  flow.  The  repurchase  program  may  be  modified,  suspended,  or terminated at any time. During the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024 and April 29, 2023, the Company made no repurchases of Class A common stock. As of April 27, 2024, the Company had repurchased an aggregate 2,302,141 shares of Class A common stock for $30.0 million, and $120.0 million remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program authorization.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated below:\n\n|                                                                                 | For the Nine Months Ended   | For the Nine Months Ended   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                                                  | April 27, 2024              | April 29, 2023              |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations            | $ 20,007                    | $ 50,680                    |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations  | (39,549)                    | 36,300                      |\n| Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations                | (11,817)                    | (10,383)                    |\n| Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations | $ (31,359)                  | $ 76,597                    |\n\n## Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 27, 2024, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $20.0 million, which consisted of a net loss from continuing operations of $83.1 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $82.8 million and a $20.4 million change in net operating assets and liabilities.  The  non-cash  charges  were  primarily  driven  by  $59.9  million  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  and  $36.5  million  of  depreciation, amortization,  and  accretion,  partially  offset  by  $12.9  million  of  changes  in  inventory  reserves.  The  change  in  net  operating  assets  and  liabilities  was primarily due to a $29.0 million change in gross inventory balances due to a decline in inventory receipts to bring inventory balances in line with current demand.\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 29, 2023, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $50.7 million, which consisted of a net loss from continuing operations of $130.0 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $115.9 million and a change of $64.7 million in net operating assets and liabilities.  The  non-cash  charges  were  primarily  driven  by  $78.4  million  of  stock-based  compensation  expense,  $31.3  million  of  depreciation  and amortization, and $16.9 million in asset impairment charges. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a change of $58.5 million in our inventory balance due to a decline in inventory receipts to bring inventory balances in line with current demand and a cash inflow of $26.6 million from income tax refunds, partially offset by a decrease of $29.7 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments.\n\n## Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 27, 2024, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $39.5 million. This was primarily due to the purchase of securities available-for-sale of $47.9 million and the purchases of property and equipment of $10.3 million, partially offset by the maturities of available-for-sale securities of $18.3 million.\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 29, 2023, cash provided in investing activities from continuing operations was $36.3 million. This was primarily due to sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities of $50.6 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $14.9 million.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 27, 2024, cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $11.8 million, primarily due to payments for tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units.\n\nDuring the nine months ended April 29, 2023, cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $10.4 million, primarily due to payments for tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\nThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and other commitments as disclosed in our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and  the  related  disclosures.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes in market risk from the information presented in Part II, Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 29, 2023.\n\n## ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation  of  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  our  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act')), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the 'Evaluation Date').\n\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere  were  no  changes  during  the  quarter  ended  April  27,  2024  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n\nAn effective  internal  control  system,  no  matter  how  well  designed,  has  inherent  limitations,  including  the  possibility  of  human  error  or  overriding  of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls,  or  fraud.  Effective  internal  controls  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  with  respect  to  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  financial statements.\n\n## PART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe  information  contained  in  Note  6,  'Commitments  and  Contingencies'  under  the  heading  'Contingencies'  within  the  Notes  to  the  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## ITEM 1A.

Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\n- \u00b7 Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\n- \u00b7 The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n- \u00b7 We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation of the value of our Class A common stock.\n- \u00b7 Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\n- \u00b7 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\n- \u00b7 Future securities sales and issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\n- \u00b7 If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our reported financial information and this may lead to a decline in our stock price.\n- \u00b7 We may not be able to generate sufficient capital to support and grow our business, and outside capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.\n- \u00b7 If securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this 'Quarterly Report'), and in our other public filings. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In such case, the  trading  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  could  decline,  and  you  may  lose  all  or  part  of  your  investment.  This  Quarterly  Report  also  contains forward-looking  statements  and  estimates  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Our  actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Business\n\nWe may be unable to retain clients or maintain a high level of engagement with our clients and maintain or increase their spending with us, which could harm our business, financial condition, or operating results.\n\nIf our existing clients no longer find our service and merchandise appealing or appropriately priced, they may make fewer purchases or may stop using our service altogether. Even if our existing clients continue to find our service and merchandise appealing, they may decide to receive fewer Fixes or purchase fewer items from their Fixes or through Freestyle as their demand for new apparel declines, due to macroeconomic conditions, or for other reasons. A high proportion  of  our  revenue  comes  from  repeat  purchases  by  existing  clients,  especially  those  existing  clients  who  are  highly  engaged  and  purchase  a significant amount of merchandise from us. If clients who receive Fixes most frequently or purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us make fewer or lower priced purchases or stop using our service altogether, our financial results will be negatively affected. For instance, in fiscal year 2023, our number of active clients decreased throughout the year due to our inability to attract new clients and retain existing clients. This negatively affected our fiscal year 2023 revenue and is expected to continue to affect our revenue in fiscal year 2024.\n\nWe seek to attract high-quality clients who will remain clients for the long term, but our efforts may not be successful or produce the results we anticipate. For example, if we are not able to engage new Fix clients effectively so they continue receiving Fixes after their first few tries, our active client growth will continue to suffer. In addition, in the fall of 2021, we launched Freestyle to new-to-Stitch Fix clients. We did not acquire as many new clients through Freestyle as we had hoped. Our inability to attract and keep high-quality clients engaged, a continued decrease in our number of active clients, or a decrease in client spending could negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Our growth depends on attracting new clients.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new clients in a cost-effective manner. To expand our client base, we must appeal to and acquire clients who have historically used other means to purchase apparel, shoes, and accessories, such as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers or other online retailers. We currently utilize both digital and offline channels to attract new visitors to our website or mobile app and subsequently convert them into clients. At any given  time,  our  advertising  efforts  may  include,  social  media  marketing,  keyword  search  campaigns,  affiliate  programs,  partnerships,  campaigns  with celebrities  and  influencers,  display  advertising,  television,  radio,  video,  content,  direct  mail,  email,  mobile  'push'  communications,  SMS,  and  search engine optimization. Our marketing expenses have varied from period to period, and we expect this trend to continue as we evolve our marketing strategies and employ a disciplined approach to marketing spend. If we increase our marketing spend, we cannot be certain that these increases will yield more clients, achieve meaningful payback on our investments, or be cost effective. We may also adjust our marketing strategy or decrease spend within a period if we are not achieving the intended results or if we believe the return-on-investment is not favorable, which may result in faster or slower rates of active client growth in any given period. For instance in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022, we spent less on marketing because we were experiencing weaker-than-expected conversion of new clients and decided to pull back to focus on evolving the Freestyle offering and refining the client onboarding experience. This negatively impacted our ability to acquire new clients, and in turn, our net revenue in subsequent quarters of fiscal year 2022. We also experienced weaker-than-expected conversion of new clients in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2022 driven by onboarding challenges and lower site traffic, due in part to the ongoing effects of Apple's iOS privacy changes that require apps to get a user's opt-in permission before tracking the user or sharing the user's data across apps or websites owned by companies other than the app's owner.\n\nIn addition, we seek to attract new clients by offering new products, services, and ways to engage with our platform, such as our Freestyle offering. If such new products or services are not timely or successfully launched or are not successful in attracting new clients, our results of operations may suffer. In fiscal 2022, our results were below our expectations, in large part, because the initial launch of Freestyle did not drive as much new client growth as we anticipated. Moreover, new clients may not purchase from us as frequently or spend as much with us as existing clients, and the revenue generated from new clients may not be as high as the revenue generated from our existing clients. These factors may harm our growth prospects and our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## We rely on paid marketing to help grow our business, but these efforts may not be successful or cost effective, and such expenses may vary from period to period.\n\nPromoting awareness of our service is important to our ability to grow our business, drive client engagement, and attract new clients. At any given time, our marketing and advertising efforts may include, client referrals, social media marketing, keyword search campaigns, affiliate programs, partnerships, campaigns with celebrities and influencers, display advertising, television, radio, video, content, direct mail, email, mobile 'push' communications, SMS, and  search  engine  optimization.  External  factors  beyond  our  control,  including  general  economic  conditions  and  decreased  discretionary  consumer spending, have impacted and may in the future impact the success of our marketing initiatives or how much we decide to spend on marketing in a given period. We also adjust our marketing activity from period to period or within a period as we launch new initiatives or offerings, such as Freestyle, run tests, or make decisions on marketing investments in response to anticipated rates of return, such as when we identify favorable cost per acquisition trends. For example,  in  the  first  and  second  fiscal  quarters  of  fiscal  year  2022,  we  spent  less  on  marketing  because  we  were  experiencing  weaker-than-expected conversion of new clients and decided to pull back to focus on evolving the Freestyle offering and refining the client onboarding experience. This led to fewer clients being acquired, which negatively impacted our net revenue for the remainder of fiscal year 2022. We have seen increased costs in certain digital marketing channels and our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive; generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur .\n\nWe currently obtain a significant number of visits to our websites via organic search engine results. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user's search, which could reduce the number of organic visits to our websites, in turn reducing new client acquisition and adversely affecting our operating results. Social networks are important as a source of new clients and as a means by which to connect with current clients, and their importance may be increasing. We may be unable to effectively maintain a presence within these networks, which could lead to lower than anticipated brand affinity and awareness, and in turn could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nFurther,  mobile  operating  system  and  web  browser  providers,  such  as  Apple  and  Google,  have  implemented  product  changes  to  limit  the  ability  of advertisers to collect and use data to target and measure advertising. For example, Apple made a change in iOS 14 that required apps to get a user's opt-in permission before tracking a user or sharing the user's data across apps or websites owned by companies other than the app's owner. Google has updated its timetable for restricting the use of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser, consistent with similar actions taken by the owners of other browsers, such as Apple in its Safari browser, and Mozilla in its Firefox browser. In early 2024, Google will begin banning third party cookies with the goal of phasing them out by the end of 2024. These changes have reduced and will continue to reduce our ability to efficiently target and measure advertising, in particular through online social networks, making our advertising less cost effective and successful. We expect to continue to be impacted by these changes.\n\nWith respect to our email marketing efforts, if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our clients or if clients do not engage with our emails, whether out of choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam, or for other reasons, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nTo ensure timely delivery of merchandise, we generally enter into purchase contracts well in advance of a particular season and often before apparel trends are confirmed by client purchases. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. We rely on our merchandising team to order styles and products that our clients will purchase and we rely on our data science to inform the depth and breadth of inventory we purchase, including when to reorder items that are selling well and when to write off items that are not selling well. We have not always predicted demand and clients' preferences with accuracy, which has negatively impacted revenue or resulted in significant write-offs when we have sub-optimal inventory assortment. For instance, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced weaker consumer demand, which caused us to have higher inventory levels and increased inventory reserves that affected our financial results.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced the closure of two U.S. fulfillment centers because we believe our inventory would be better optimized across a smaller network of warehouses in the U.S., allowing us to deliver a better client experience with access to a greater breadth inventory for a given Fix, while at the same time operating with lower, more cash efficient,\n\ninventory levels. This smaller inventory base and our focus on inventory efficiency creates increased risk related to inventory assortment. If we experience sub-optimal inventory assortment to meet demand, it may affect revenue in current and future quarters. If we do not predict client demand accurately, do not  reorder  or  write  off  the  right  products  in  a  timely  manner,  or  otherwise  do  not  effectively  manage  our  inventory,  we  may  experience  significant inventory write-offs or insufficient inventory to meet demand, which would adversely affect our operating results.\n\nAdditionally, many of our inventory vendors utilize third parties to provide financing and credit protection that enables them produce and ship our items. While we do not manage the relationships with our vendors and their  financial  intermediaries,  the  tightening  of  credit  markets,  as  well  as  our  recent operating results and expected future results, have put pressure on some of our vendors' ability to secure that financing and credit protection, and may continue to do so in the future. This may impact our ability to receive inventory and manage our assortment.\n\nOur  inventory  levels  also  may  be  affected  by  product  launch  delays,  consumer  demand  fluctuations  due  to  macroeconomic  factors,  uncertainty  or otherwise, disruptions in our systems due to upgrades, launches or otherwise, freight delays, vendor relationships, capacity constraints, and our inability to predict demand with respect to categories or products. For example, freight delays caused by lockdowns due to COVID-19, port closures, port congestion, and shipping container and ship shortages have affected us and caused us to experience delays in receiving inventory. Freight delays caused by these issues or new issues, including labor disruptions or shortages, may affect us in future quarters. Also, in the past we have experienced challenges managing our inventory within the fulfillment centers given storage capacity constraints and challenges hiring fulfillment center employees. Any future such challenges could affect, the amount and types of inventory we have available to offer to clients, and therefore negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Operational constraints at our fulfillment centers or our failure to adequately and effectively staff our fulfillment centers could adversely affect our client experience and operating results.\n\nWe currently receive and distribute merchandise at three fulfillment centers in the United States. Prior to the closures of our Dallas, Texas and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania fulfillment centers, we operated five fulfillment centers in the United States. While we believe three fulfillment centers is the appropriate number to provide the greatest breadth and depth of inventory to our clients and stylists and will allow us to service the same number of existing clients with lower inventory levels, this decreased fulfillment system could cause operational constraints or decreased capacity that could significantly affect our client experience or revenue. Additionally, we may experience operational issues as we continue to transition to our new fulfillment center model which could affect our client experience and financial results.\n\nSevere weather events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, storms, and other adverse weather events and climate conditions could also cause operational constraints or temporarily reduce our ability to ship merchandise to clients. For instance, the severe winter weather and temperatures experienced in Texas and other parts of the country in February 2021 caused us to temporarily close two of our fulfillment centers and affected the shipping of merchandise in and out of our fulfillment centers. Future weather events, which we expect to become more frequent and more severe with the increasing effects of climate change, could have a significant impact on our operations and results of operations. Additionally, the impact of such weather events affecting one or more fulfillment center may be exacerbated due to the fact that we will have fewer fulfillment centers to continue operations during such a closure and therefore each individual fulfillment center will represent a larger portion of our overall business. Further, during the third quarter of our 2020 fiscal  year,  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  temporarily  closed  three  of  our  fulfillment  centers  and  implemented  changes  that  resulted  in operational constraints, which in turn temporarily reduced our ability to ship merchandise to clients and earn revenue. In fiscal year 2021, we experienced smaller, intermittent interruptions in connection with an increase of COVID-19 cases in our fulfillment centers. Any future surges of COVID-19 or future pandemics may negatively affect capacity at our fulfillment centers.\n\nWe have  in  the  past  experienced  difficulty  hiring  employees  in  our  fulfillment  centers,  which  we  attributed  to  COVID-19  concerns  and  to  increased competition and rising wages for eCommerce fulfillment center workers. To address this, we increased wages in our fulfillment centers and implemented other  policies  in  order  to  be  more  competitive  in  hiring  employees.  These  wage  increases  impacted  our  operating  results.  We  may  in  the  future  have difficulty hiring employees in fulfillment centers due to increased competition or otherwise and we may have to increase wages for our fulfillment center employees, which would impact our operating results. These hiring difficulties have caused capacity constraints in our fulfillment centers in the past and could  in  the  future  cause  capacity  constraints.  Capacity  constraints  in  our  fulfillment  centers  could  affect  the  amount  and  types  of  inventory  we  have available to offer to clients, which will affect our results of operations. Any capacity constraints due to hiring difficulties may be exacerbated due to the fact that we will have fewer fulfillment centers. If we are unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers to meet demand, or if the cost of such staffing is higher than projected due to competition, mandated wage increases, regulatory changes, or other factors, our operating results will be further harmed.\n\nIn  addition,  operating  fulfillment  centers  comes with potential risks, such as workplace safety issues and employment claims for the failure or alleged failure  to  comply  with  labor  laws  or  laws  respecting  union  organizing  activities.  Furthermore,  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  wage  and  hour  laws  for  our nonexempt employees, many of whom work in our fulfillment centers, we could be subject to legal risk, including claims for back wages, unpaid overtime pay, and missed meal and rest periods, which could be on a class or representative basis. Any such issues may result in delays in shipping times, reduced packing quality, or costly litigation, and our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\n\n## Shipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe currently rely on three major vendors for our shipping. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these entities, shipping prices  increase  at  unexpected  levels,  or  our  shipping  vendors  experience  performance  problems  or  other  difficulties,  it  could  negatively  impact  our operating  results  and  our  clients'  experience.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  receive  inbound  inventory  efficiently,  ship  merchandise  to  clients,  and  receive returned merchandise from clients may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor disputes, shortages, or strikes, acts of war or terrorism, periods of high e-commerce volume, such as holiday seasons, and similar factors. Due to our business model and the fact that we recognize revenue from Fixes when a client checks out items, rather than when Fixes are shipped, we may be impacted by shipping delays to a greater extent than our competitors. Additionally, delays in shipping may cause an auto-ship client's subsequent Fixes to be scheduled for a later date, as their next Fix is not scheduled until their checkout is complete. In the second quarter of our 2021 fiscal year, we experienced carrier and client shipping delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased strain on our shipping partners during the holiday season. These delays affected our ability to recognize revenue within the quarter, and we may in the future experience these delays and the resulting impact to our financial results, including potentially during future holiday seasons. In the past, strikes at major international shipping ports have impacted our supply of inventory from our vendors and severe weather events have resulted in long delivery delays and Fix cancellations. Additionally, some of our merchandise may be damaged or lost during transit with our shipping vendors. If a greater portion of our merchandise is not delivered in a timely fashion or is  damaged or lost  during  transit,  it  could  adversely  affect  our  operating  results  or  could  cause  our  clients  to  become  dissatisfied  and  cease  using  our services, which would adversely affect our business.\n\n## Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with the sourcing and pricing of merchandise and raw materials.\n\nWe currently source nearly all of the merchandise that we offer from third-party vendors, many of whom use manufacturers in the same geographic region, and as a result we may be subject to price increases or fluctuations, inflationary pressures, tariffs, demand disruptions, increased shipping or freight costs, or shipping delays in connection with our merchandise. Increased shipping or freights costs or shipping and freight delays could be caused or exacerbated by labor disputes, shortages, or strikes, inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war or terrorism, and periods of high e-commerce volume. Our operating results are and have been negatively impacted by increases in the cost of our merchandise, and we have no guarantees that costs will not rise further or at increasing rates. In addition, if we expand into new categories and product types, we expect that we may not have strong purchasing power in these new areas, which could lead to higher costs than we have historically seen in our current categories. We may not be able to pass increased costs on to clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nThe fabrics used by our vendors are made of raw materials including, but not limited to, petroleum-based products and cotton. Significant price increases or fluctuations, currency volatility or fluctuation, tariffs, shortages, increases in shipping or freight costs, or shipping delays of petroleum, cotton, or other raw materials could significantly increase our cost of goods sold or affect our operating results. Additionally, we have limited visibility into delays and limited control over shipping. We have also experienced increased costs of goods due to freight challenges, increases in the price of raw materials, inflationary pressures, rising fuel and other energy costs, and currency volatility. Any additional price increases will affect our operating results.\n\nOther factors such as natural disasters have in the past increased raw material costs, impacted pricing with certain of our vendors, and caused shipping delays for certain of our merchandise. Also, the U.S. government's ban on cotton imported from the Xinjiang region of China, the source of a large portion of the world's cotton supply, may impact prices and the availability of cotton for our merchandise. Additionally, our products and materials (including potentially non-cotton materials) could be held for inspection by the United States Customs Border Protection (the 'U.S. CBP'), which would cause delays and unexpectedly affect our inventory levels. In addition, the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacture of the merchandise we offer, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, damage to, or increased costs in raw materials or the manufacture of the merchandise we offer could result in higher prices to acquire the merchandise, or non-delivery of merchandise altogether, and could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee that merchandise we receive from vendors will be of sufficient quality or free from damage, or that such merchandise will not  be  damaged  during  shipping,  while  stored  in  one  of  our  fulfillment  centers,  or  when  returned  by  customers.  While  we  take  measures  to  ensure merchandise  quality  and  avoid  damage,  we  cannot  control  merchandise  while  it  is  out  of  our  possession.  We  may  incur  additional  expenses  and  our reputation could be harmed if clients and potential clients believe that our merchandise is not of high quality or may be damaged.\n\n## We may not be able to return to revenue growth and we may not be profitable in the future.\n\nOur past revenue growth and profitability should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Our revenue decreased by 15.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, decreased by 21.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and decreased by 2.2% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Our revenue may continue to decline in future periods due to a number of factors, which may include our inability to attract and retain clients, general economic conditions, including a recession or decreased discretionary consumer spending, decreases in marketing spend, a decreased demand for our merchandise and service, increased competition, decreases in the growth rate of our overall market, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.\n\nWe announced a restructuring plan in June 2022, intended to reduce our future fixed and variable operating costs. However, our restructuring plan may not adequately reduce expenses or impact our results as we anticipate. Moreover, our expenses may increase, particularly if we develop and introduce new merchandise offerings,  including  the  planned  re-imagination  of  our  client  experience,  need  to  hire  and  retain  personnel,  or  increase  investment  in  our marketing initiatives. We may not always pursue short-term profits but are often focused on long-term growth, which may impact our financial results. If our revenue does not increase to offset increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods.\n\n## If we fail to effectively manage our business, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n\nWe must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, and improve and expand our infrastructure of people and technology. Additionally, we expect  to  continue  to  introduce  new  offerings,  business  strategies  and  initiatives,  and  improve  on  existing  offerings.  Our  operations,  vendor  base, fulfillment centers, information technology systems, or internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our changing operations. Any change or upgrade to our systems to support the increasing complexity of our business involves risk and we may experience problems or delays as we make upgrades or changes to our systems. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced technical issues following a systems upgrade to our procure-to-pay  processes  which  affected  the  transmission,  receipt,  and  reconciliation  of  purchase  orders  and  payments  with  many  of  our  apparel  and accessory vendors. The roll-out of new offerings and initiatives, including the planned re-imagination of our client experience, require investments of time and resources and may require changes in our website, mobile apps, information technology systems or processes, which involves inherent risk. These initiatives and changes also may not be rolled out as timely or effectively as we expect or may not produce the results we intend. If new offerings and initiatives are delayed, it could affect our inventory levels. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, or if growth initiatives are not introduced timely, do not produce the anticipated results, or cause unanticipated issues, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  fail  to  attract  and  retain  key  personnel,  effectively  manage  succession,  or  hire,  develop,  and  motivate  our  employees,  our  business,  financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our management team and in our merchandising, algorithms, engineering, marketing, styling, and other organizations. We do not currently maintain key-person life insurance policies on any member of our senior management team or other key employees.\n\nWe  do  not  have  long-term  employment  or  non-competition  agreements  with  any  of  our  personnel.  We  have  had  senior  employees  leave  Stitch  Fix, including most recently the roles of Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief People Officer, and cannot necessarily anticipate when this will happen in the future  and  whether  we  will  be  able  to  promptly  replace  such  employees.  Additionally,  in  January  2023,  the  Company  and  Elizabeth  Spaulding,  the Company's then-current Chief Executive Officer, agreed that she would step down from her employment with the Company and the Board of Directors appointed Katrina Lake, the Company's Founder and Executive Chairperson of the Board of Directors, as interim Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Lake served in that position until Matt Baer joined as Chief Executive Officer of the Company in June 2023. The recent frequent changes in our management team and senior leadership could cause retention and morale concerns among current employees, as well as operational risks. And if Mr. Baer's succession to Chief Executive Officer is not managed successfully, including his ability to lead a team that can effectively implement the Company's strategic plans, it could disrupt our business, affect our Company culture, cause retention concerns with respect to our colleagues, and affect our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to promptly identify a suitable successor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business,\n\nWe have experienced increased employee turnover as a result of the general market conditions and a competitive talent market within the U.S., as well as Company-specific factors, such as share price decline, business performance, and leadership\n\nchanges, and we expect to continue to experience increased employee turnover in the future. We announced a restructuring plan in June 2022 that reduced our workforce by 15% of salaried positions and represents 4% of our roles in total, and announced a further reduction in force on January 5, 2023, affecting 6% of the Company's then-current employee workforce, including approximately 20% of employees in salaried positions. In June 2023, we announced the closure of two fulfillment centers and our intention to enter a consultation period to explore exiting the market in the U.K. and on August 24, 2023, we ended  the  consultation  period  and  made  the  decision  to  exit  our  UK  business  and  wind  down  operations.  And  in  January  2024,  we  implemented  an organization realignment that resulted in the further elimination of styling leadership and corporate positions. These reductions in workforce and change in our operations may cause additional attrition and affect employee morale. Additionally, as we are operating our business with fewer employees, we face additional  risk  that  we  might  not  be  able  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  and  product  roadmap,  which  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe also face significant competition for personnel, particularly in our technology and product organizations. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. We also have in the past had difficulty hiring employees in fulfillment centers due to increased competition for distribution workers and rising wages and have increased our employee compensation levels in response to competition, as necessary.\n\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future, or that the compensation costs of doing so will not adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to hire and train new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to retain employees and effectively manage our hiring needs, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, employee morale, productivity, and  the  success  of  our  strategic  plans  and  product  roadmap  could  suffer,  which  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  and operating results.\n\n## If we are unable to develop and introduce new offerings or expand into new markets in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur initial merchandise offering was Women's apparel, but since our inception we expanded our merchandise offerings to include Petite, Maternity, Men's, Plus, Premium Brands, and Kids. In June 2019, we introduced our direct-buy functionality (now called 'Freestyle') with Buy It Again allowing clients in the United States to buy previously purchased items in new colors, prints, and sizes. We expanded direct buy with Complete Your Looks, which allows clients to discover and shop personalized outfits with new items that complement their prior purchases, Trending For You, which allows clients to shop personalized looks based on their style profiles, and Categories, a new way for clients to easily discover pieces within a range of categories based on occasion, brand, or item type. And, in August 2021, we opened up Freestyle to new-to-Stitch Fix clients who had never received a Fix from us previously. We continue to explore additional offerings to serve our existing clients, attract new clients, and expand our geographic scope.\n\nNew offerings may not have the same success, or gain traction as quickly, as our current offerings. If our new offerings are not accepted by our clients or do not attract new clients, our sales may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, and we may incur expenses that are not offset by sales. Developing new offerings requires significant investments of resources and time, and if a new offering is not successful, our business may not grow as anticipated. If the launch of a new category or offering requires investments greater than we expect, is delayed or is not executed well, our operating results could be negatively impacted. For example, in launching Freestyle to new customers during our fiscal 2022, we implemented client onboarding changes in an effort to drive new clients to Freestyle. These changes resulted in lower conversion of new clients to our Fix offering, which impacted our operating results. Also, our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract brands and other merchandise vendors that produce sufficient high-quality, appropriately priced, and on-trend merchandise.\n\nOur current merchandise offerings have a range of margin profiles and we believe new offerings will also have a broad range of margin profiles that will affect our operating results. If we enter into new categories, we may not have as high purchasing power as we do in our current offerings, which could increase our costs of goods sold and further reduce our margins. Expansion of our merchandise offerings may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional merchandise buyers to source new merchandise and to allocate new categories across our distribution network. We may also face greater competition in specific categories from companies that are more focused on these areas. For instance, our entry into the Kids category means we now compete with a number of additional companies that have been in the Kids category for a longer period of time and may have more experience in children's clothing. If any of the above were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## We have a short operating history in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\n\nWe have a short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop in a manner favorable to our business. Our relatively short operating history makes it difficult to assess our future performance. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 cost-effectively acquire new clients and engage with and retain existing clients;\n- \u00b7 manage our inventory effectively;\n- \u00b7 adequately and effectively staff our fulfillment centers;\n- \u00b7 anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes;\n- \u00b7 increase our market share;\n- \u00b7 increase consumer awareness of our brand and maintain our reputation;\n- \u00b7 successfully expand our offering;\n- \u00b7 anticipate and respond to changing style trends and consumer preferences;\n- \u00b7 compete effectively;\n- \u00b7 avoid interruptions in our business from information technology downtime, cybersecurity breaches, or labor stoppages;\n- \u00b7 effectively manage our growth;\n- \u00b7 continue to enhance our personalization capabilities;\n- \u00b7 hire, integrate, and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\n- \u00b7 maintain and improve the quality of our technology infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 develop new features to enhance the client experience; and\n- \u00b7 retain our existing merchandise vendors and attract new vendors.\n\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, our business and our operating results will be adversely affected.\n\n## Our business depends on a strong brand and we may not be able to maintain our brand and reputation.\n\nWe believe that maintaining the Stitch Fix brand and reputation is critical to driving client engagement and attracting clients and merchandise vendors. Building our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide our clients with an engaging and personalized client experience, including valued personal styling services, high-quality merchandise, and appropriate price points, which we may not do successfully. Client complaints or negative publicity about our styling services, merchandise, delivery times, or client support, especially on social media platforms, could harm our reputation and diminish client use of our services, the trust that our clients place in Stitch Fix, and vendor confidence in us.\n\nOur  brand  depends  in  part  on  effective  client  support,  which  requires  significant  personnel  expense.  Failure  to  manage  or  train  our  client  support representatives properly or inability to handle client complaints effectively could negatively affect our brand, reputation, and operating results.\n\nIf we fail to cost-effectively promote and maintain the Stitch Fix brand, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to effectively manage our stylists, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nAs of April 27, 2024, approximately 2,020 of our employees were stylists. In January 2024, we moved to a part-time only stylist model, and going forward, all of our stylists will work on a part-time basis and be paid hourly. The stylists track and report the time they spend working for us. These employees are classified as nonexempt under federal and state law. If we fail to effectively manage our stylists, including by ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of their  hours  worked  and  proper  processing  of  their  hourly  wages,  then  we  may  face  claims  alleging  violations  of  wage  and  hour  employment  laws, including,  without  limitation,  claims  of  back  wages,  unpaid  overtime  pay,  and  missed  meal  and  rest  periods.  Any  such  employee  litigation  could  be attempted on a class or representative basis. For example, in August 2020, a representative action under California's Private Attorneys General Act was filed against us alleging various violations of California's wage and hour laws relating to our current and former non-exempt stylist employees. While we were able to settle this matter, future litigation concerning our\n\nstyling employees could be expensive and time-consuming regardless of whether the claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, and could divert management's attention from our business. We could also be adversely affected by negative publicity, litigation costs resulting from the defense of these claims, and the diversion of time and resources from our operations.\n\n## If we are unable to acquire new merchandise vendors or retain existing merchandise vendors, our operating results may be harmed.\n\nWe offer merchandise from hundreds of established and emerging brands. In order to continue to attract and retain quality merchandise brands, we must help merchandise vendors increase their sales and offer them a high-quality, cost-effective fulfillment process.\n\nIf we do not continue to acquire new merchandise vendors or retain our existing merchandise vendors on acceptable commercial terms, we may not be able to maintain a broad selection of products for our clients, and our operating results may suffer.\n\nIn addition, our Owned Private Label Brands are sourced from third-party vendors and contract manufacturers. The loss of one of our Owned Private Label Brand vendors for any reason, or our inability to source any additional vendors needed for our Owned Private Label Brands, could require us to source Owned Private Label Brands merchandise from another vendor or manufacturer, which could cause inventory delays, impact our clients' experiences, and otherwise harm our operating results.\n\n## We may incur significant losses from fraud.\n\nWe have in the past incurred and may in the future incur losses from various types of fraud, including stolen credit card numbers, claims that a client did not authorize a purchase, merchant fraud, and clients who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in open bank accounts to satisfy payments. Our clients  may  re-use  their  login  information  (i.e.,  username  and  password  combination)  across  multiple  websites  and,  therefore,  when  a  third-party website experiences a data breach, that information could be exposed to bad actors and be used to fraudulently access our clients' accounts. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if the fraud is related to credit card transactions and becomes excessive, it could result in us paying higher fees or losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, under current credit card practices, we are typically liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. Our failure to adequately prevent fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory action, and lead to expenses that could substantially impact our operating results.\n\n## We are subject to payment-related risks.\n\nWe accept payments online via credit and debit cards and online payment systems such as PayPal, which subjects us to certain regulations and fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to clients that would be subject to additional regulations and risks. We pay interchange and other fees in connection with credit card payments, which may increase over time and adversely affect our operating results. While we use a third party to process payments, we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Relating to our Industry, the Market, and the Economy\n\n## We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.\n\nOur business and operating results are subject to national and global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment; higher consumer debt levels; reductions in net worth and declines in asset values; macroeconomic uncertainty; recessionary concerns; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates, increased inflationary pressures and credit availability; rising fuel and other energy costs; rising commodity prices; and general uncertainty regarding the  overall  future  political  and  economic  environment.  We  have  experienced  many  of  these  factors,  including  current  inflationary  pressures,  and  have experienced  negative  impacts  on  client  demand  and  discretionary  spending  as  a  result.  Consumer  purchases  of  discretionary  items,  including  the merchandise that we offer, generally decline during recessionary periods or periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there  is  a  reduction  in  consumer  confidence.  Furthermore,  economic  conditions  in  certain  regions  may  also  be  affected  by  natural  disasters,  such  as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and wildfires; public health crises; and other major unforeseen events.\n\nAdverse economic changes could reduce consumer confidence, and could thereby negatively affect our operating results. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact such circumstances could have on our business. Additionally, the ongoing volatile and uncertain\n\nmacroeconomic environment that we have been experiencing since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has likely reduced, and may continue to reduce, our ability to forecast our future operating results.\n\n## Our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nThe retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with eCommerce companies that market the same or similar merchandise and services that we offer;  local,  national,  and  global  department  stores;  specialty  retailers;  discount  chains;  independent  retail  stores;  and  the  online  offerings  of  these traditional retail competitors. Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories. We believe our ability to compete depends on many factors within and beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 effectively differentiating our service and value proposition from those of our competitors;\n- \u00b7 attracting new clients and engaging with and retaining existing clients;\n- \u00b7 our direct relationships with our clients and their willingness to share personal information with us;\n- \u00b7 further developing our data science capabilities;\n- \u00b7 maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our services to clients;\n- \u00b7 delivering merchandise that each client perceives as personalized to them;\n- \u00b7 the amount, diversity, and quality of brands and merchandise that we or our competitors offer;\n- \u00b7 our ability to expand and maintain appealing Owned Private Label Brands and exclusive-to-Stitch Fix merchandise;\n- \u00b7 the price at which we are able to offer our merchandise;\n- \u00b7 the speed and cost at which we can deliver merchandise to our clients and the ease with which they can use our services to return merchandise; and\n- \u00b7 anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and consumer shopping preferences.\n\nMany of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories; larger fulfillment infrastructures; greater technical capabilities; faster shipping times; lower-cost shipping; larger databases; more purchasing power; higher profiles; greater financial, marketing, institutional, and other resources; and larger customer bases than we do. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater revenue and profits from their existing customer bases; acquire customers at lower costs; or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, changes in apparel trends and consumer shopping behavior, and changes in supply conditions. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, enter or expand their presence in the personalized retail  market,  undertake  more  far-reaching  marketing  campaigns,  and  adopt  more  aggressive  pricing  policies,  which  may  allow  them  to  build  larger customer bases or generate revenue from their existing customer bases more effectively than we do. If we fail to execute on any of the above better than our competitors, our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\n## Our operating results have been, and could be in the future, adversely affected by natural disasters,  public  health  crises,  political  crises,  or  other catastrophic events.\n\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, snow or ice storms, and other adverse weather events and climate conditions, which we expect to become more frequent and more severe with the increasing effects of climate change; unforeseen public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability, including the ongoing international conflicts; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations or cause us to close one or more of our offices and fulfillment centers or could disrupt, delay, or otherwise negatively impact the operations of one or more of our thirdparty providers or vendors. For instance, the severe winter weather and temperatures experienced in Texas and other parts of the country in February 2021 caused us to temporarily close two of our fulfillment centers and affected the shipping of merchandise in and out of fulfillment centers. Furthermore, these types of events could impact our merchandise supply chain, including our ability to ship merchandise to or receive returned merchandise from clients in the impacted region, and could impact our ability or the ability of third parties to operate our sites and ship merchandise. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions.\n\nIn fact, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our operations in and caused us to temporarily close our offices and require that most of our employees work from home; disrupted our operations in and caused us to close fulfillment centers; required us to implement various operational changes to ensure the health and safety of our employees; had a range of negative effects on the operations of our third-party providers and vendors, including our merchandise supply chain and shipping partners; and negatively impacted consumer spending and the economy generally due to measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19,\n\nsuch as government-mandated business closures, office closures, state and local orders to 'shelter in place,' and travel and transportation restrictions, and otherwise.  We  experienced  reduced  capacity  in  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2020  as  we  temporarily  closed  three  of  our  fulfillment  centers  as  we responded to the pandemic. We allowed employees to opt-in to work, provided them with four weeks of flexible paid time off, and implemented additional safety protocols. These efforts resulted in significantly less capacity in our fulfillment centers during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, which resulted in delayed Fix shipments, a significant Fix backlog, delayed inventory and return processing, extended wait times for clients, and inventory management challenges.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  and  resulting  economic  disruption  also  led  to  significant  volatility  in  the  capital  markets.  We  re-opened  our headquarters to employees in the third quarter of 2022, but most employees to continue to work in a remote capacity or a hybrid of in-person and remote work. Remote working environments present additional risks, uncertainties and costs that could affect our performance, including increased operational risk,  uncertainty  regarding  office  space  needs,  heightened  vulnerability  to  cyber  attacks  due  to  increased  remote  work,  potential  reduced  productivity, changes to our Company culture, potential strains to our business continuity plans, and increased costs to ensure our offices are safe and functional as hybrid offices that enable effective collaboration of both remote and in-person colleagues. The COVID-19 pandemic caused many risks as described above and throughout these risk factors to materialize and adversely affected our business and operating results. Any future resurgences of COVID-19 or the occurrence of another natural disaster, pandemic, or crisis could disrupt our operations or negatively impact consumer spending, adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\n\n## Cybersecurity, Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## System interruptions that impair client access to our website or other performance failures or supply chain issues in our technology infrastructure could damage our business.\n\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our website, mobile application, internal applications, and technology infrastructure (and those of our third-party vendors and service providers) are critical to our business. We rely on our website and mobile application to engage with our clients and sell  them  merchandise.  We  also  rely  on  a  host  of  internal  custom-built  applications  to  run  critical  business  functions,  such  as  styling,  merchandise purchasing, warehouse operations, and order fulfillment. In addition, we rely on a variety of third-party, cloud-based solution vendors for key elements of our technology infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption and we have experienced interruptions in the past. For example, in February 2017, as a result of an outage with Amazon Web Services, where much of our technology infrastructure is hosted, we experienced disruptions in applications that support our warehouse operations and order fulfillment that caused a temporary slowdown in the number of Fix shipments we were able to make. Additionally, the launch of a new category or new product offering requires investments in and the development of new technology, which may be more susceptible to performance issues or interruptions. Interruptions may also be caused by a variety of incidents, including human error, our failure to update or improve our proprietary systems, cyber attacks, fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, or telecommunications failures. These risks are exacerbated by our move to a more remote workforce. Any failure or interruption of our website, mobile application, internal business applications, or our technology infrastructure  (including  any  such  issues  with  our  third-party  vendors  and  service  providers)  could  harm  our  ability  to  serve  our  clients,  which  would adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Compromises of our data security or that of our third-party service providers could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and may materially harm our reputation and operating results.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our vendors and service providers collect, process, and store certain personal information and other data relating to individuals, such as our clients and employees, which may include client payment card information. We rely substantially on commercially available  systems,  software,  tools,  and  monitoring  to  provide  security  for  our  processing,  transmission,  and  storage  of  personal  information  and  other confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that we or our vendors will not suffer a data compromise, that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information or other sensitive data, including payment card data or confidential business information, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely fashion. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, and we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As we have moved to a more remote and hybrid work force, and as our vendors and other business partners have also moved to permanent or hybrid remote work as well, we and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, our employees, contractors, vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such personal information, confidential information, or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data.\n\nCompromise of our data security or the data security of third parties with whom we do business, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business  information,  and  delays  in  detecting  or  providing  prompt  notice  of  any  such  compromise  or  loss  could  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our reputation,  and  subject  us  to  litigation,  government  action,  or  other  additional  costs  and  liabilities  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Some of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary applications.\n\nWe use open source software in the applications we have developed to operate our business and will use open source software in the future. We may face claims from third parties demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed from such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation  and  could  require  us  to  purchase  a  costly  license,  publicly  release  the  affected  portions  of  our  source  code,  or  cease  offering  the  implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. In addition, our use of open source software may present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\n## Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\n\nCurrently, we are involved in various legal proceedings, including the securities litigation and other matters described elsewhere herein. We have in the past and  may  in  the  future  become  involved  in  other  private  actions,  collective  actions,  investigations,  and  various  other  legal  proceedings  by  clients, employees,  suppliers,  competitors,  government  agencies,  stockholders,  or  others.  The  results  of  any  such  litigation,  investigations,  and  other  legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us or our vendors to comply with product safety, labor, or other laws, or our standard vendor terms and conditions, or to provide safe factory conditions for our or their workers, may damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business.\n\nThe merchandise we sell to our clients is subject to regulation by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As a result, such merchandise could in the future be subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety, labeling, and licensing concerns may result in us voluntarily removing selected merchandise from our inventory. Such recalls or voluntary removal of merchandise can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation, and increased client service costs and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nSome of the  merchandise  we  sell,  including  our  children's  merchandise,  may  expose  us  to  product  liability  claims  and  litigation  or  regulatory  action relating to personal injury or environmental or property damage. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular vendor's merchandise or our vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations.\n\nWe purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and international vendors. Our standard vendor terms and conditions require vendors to comply with applicable laws. We have hired independent firms that conduct audits of the working conditions at the factories producing our Owned Private Label Brands products. If an audit reveals potential problems, we require that the vendor institute corrective action plans to bring the factory into compliance with our standards, or we may discontinue our relationship with the vendor. The loss of an Owned Private Label Brands vendor due to failure to comply with our standards could cause inventory delays, impact our clients' experiences, and otherwise harm our operating results. In addition, failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs.  Furthermore,  the  failure  of  any  such  vendors  to  provide  safe  and  humane  factory  conditions  and  oversight  at  their  facilities  could  damage  our reputation with clients or result in legal claims against us.\n\nChina's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the 'XUAR') is the source of large amounts of cotton and textiles for the global apparel supply chain. The United States Treasury Department placed sanctions on China's Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation ('XPCC') for serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in XUAR. Additionally, the U.S.'s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act ('UFLPA'), empowers the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (the 'U.S. CBP') to withhold release of items produced in whole or in part in the XUAR, or produced by companies included on a government-created UFLPA entity list, creating a presumption that such goods were produced using forced labor. XPCC controls many of the cotton farms  and  much  of  the  textile  industry  in  the  region,  and  many  large  factories  in  XUAR  produce  fabrics  and  yarn  for  apparel.  Although  we  do  not intentionally source any products or materials from the XUAR (either directly or indirectly through our suppliers), we have no known involvement with XPCC or its subsidiaries and affiliates, and we\n\nprohibit our apparel vendors from doing business with XPCC or using forced labor, we do not have the ability to completely map our product supply chain, and we could be subject to penalties, fines or sanctions if any of the vendors from which we purchase goods is found to have dealings, directly or indirectly, with XPCC or entities it controls. Additionally, our products or materials (including potentially non-cotton materials) could be held or delayed by the U.S. CBP, which would cause delays and unexpectedly affect our inventory levels. Even if we were not subject to penalties, fines or sanctions, if products we source are linked in any way to XPCC, the XUAR, or an entity on the UFLPA entity list, our reputation could be damaged.\n\n## Our use of personal information, other personal data, and sensitive information subjects us to privacy laws and other obligations (such as cybersecurity and data protection in contracts), and our compliance with or failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\n\nWe collect and maintain significant amounts of personal information and other data relating to our clients and employees. Numerous laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and internationally, including the European Union's ('EU') General Data Protection Regulation (the 'GDPR'), California's Consumer Privacy Act (the 'CCPA') and the UK's Data Protection Act (the 'UK GDPR'), govern privacy and the collection, use, and protection of personal information. These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may be interpreted to conflict with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or with other obligations to which we may be or become subject, may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and operating results.  For  example,  the  GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Further, the UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020 ('Brexit'). The UK GDPR, which regulates data protection in the UK since Brexit, has remained consistent with the EU GDPR in effect since 2018, but it may evolve and it is uncertain whether our operations in, and data transfers to and from, the UK can comply with any future changes in the law.\n\nAlthough there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the UK's standard contractual clauses, the UK's International Data Transfer Agreement/Addendum, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework  (which  allows  for  transfers  for  relevant  U.S.-based  organizations  who  self-certify  compliance  and  participate  in  the  Framework),  these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the UK (or other applicable jurisdictions) to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions (such as Europe) at significant expense, increased  exposure  to  regulatory  actions,  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  the  inability  to  transfer  data  and  work  with  partners,  vendors  and  other  third parties,  and  injunctions  against  our  processing  or  transferring  of  personal  data  necessary  to  operate  our  business.  Additionally,  companies  that  transfer personal data out of the UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and  activist  groups.  Some  European  regulators  have  ordered  certain  companies  to  suspend  or  permanently  cease  certain  transfers  out  of  Europe  for allegedly violating the GDPR's cross-border data transfer limitations.\n\nFurthermore, the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ('CPRA') (collectively, 'CCPA'), applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for administrative fines of up to $7,500 per violation and allows  private  litigants  affected  by  certain  data  breaches  to  recover  significant  statutory  damages.  In  addition,  the  CPRA  expanded  the  CCPA's requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal information and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. A number of other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. These developments further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. Further, the SEC has adopted new rules that require us to provide greater disclosures around proactive security protections that we employ and reactive issues (e.g., security incidents). Any such disclosures, including those under state data breach notification laws, can be costly, and the disclosures we make to comply with, or the failure to comply with, such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\n\nThe costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy and data security laws and regulations may reduce the efficiency of our marketing, lead to negative publicity, make it more difficult or more costly to meet expectations of or commitments to clients, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could harm our business. These laws could also impact our ability to offer our products in certain locations. The costs, burdens, and potential\n\nliabilities imposed by existing privacy laws could be compounded if other jurisdictions in the U.S. begin to adopt similar or more restrictive laws.\n\nEven the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit clients' use of our service or harm our brand and reputation. Furthermore, our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in such contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. Also, although we maintain insurance, the costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and could cause us to incur significant expenses beyond any of our insurance coverage.\n\nAny of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\n\n## Unfavorable  changes  or  failure  by  us  to  comply  with  evolving  internet  and  eCommerce  regulations  could  substantially  harm  our  business  and operating results.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  general  business  regulations  and  laws  as  well  as  regulations  and  laws  specifically  governing  the  internet  and  eCommerce.  These regulations and laws may involve taxes, privacy and data security, consumer protection, the ability to collect or share necessary information that allows us to  conduct business on the internet, marketing communications and advertising, content protection, electronic contracts, or gift cards. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape impacting internet and eCommerce businesses is constantly evolving. For example, California's Automatic Renewal Law requires companies to adhere to enhanced disclosure requirements when entering into automatically renewing contracts with consumers. As a result, a wave of consumer class action lawsuits was brought against companies that offer online products and services on a subscription or recurring basis. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, lost business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could impact our operating results.\n\nIf  the  use  of  'cookie'  tracking  technologies  is  further  restricted,  regulated,  or  blocked,  or  if  changes  in  technology  cause  cookies  to  become  less reliable  or  acceptable  as  a  means  of  tracking  consumer  behavior,  the  amount  or  accuracy  of  internet  user  information  we  collect  would  decrease, which could harm our business and operating results.\n\nCookies are small data files that are sent by websites and stored locally on an internet user's computer or mobile device. We, and third parties who work on our behalf, collect data via cookies that is used to track the behavior of visitors to our sites, to provide a more personal and interactive experience, and to increase  the  effectiveness  of  our  marketing.  However,  internet  users  can  easily  disable,  delete,  and  block  cookies  directly  through  browser  settings  or through other software, browser extensions, or hardware platforms that physically block cookies from being created and stored.\n\nPrivacy regulations restrict how we deploy our cookies and this could potentially (a) increase the number of internet users that choose to proactively disable cookies on their systems or (b) cause or business partners, service providers, or vendors to no longer maintain their cookie processes. We may have to develop alternative systems to determine our clients' behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market to them if clients block cookies or regulations introduce additional barriers to collecting cookie data.\n\n## If we cannot successfully protect our intellectual property, our business would suffer.\n\nWe rely  on  trademark,  copyright,  trade  secrets,  patents,  confidentiality  agreements,  and  other  practices  to  protect  our  brands,  proprietary  information, technologies, and processes. Our principal trademark assets include the registered trademarks 'Stitch Fix' and 'Fix,' multiple private label clothing and accessory brand names, and our logos and taglines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that support our brand and consumers' perception of our services and merchandise. We also hold the rights to the 'stitchfix.com' internet domain name and various other related domain names, which are subject to internet regulatory bodies and trademark and other related laws of each applicable jurisdiction. If we are unable to protect our trademarks or domain names in the United States, the UK, or in other jurisdictions in which we may ultimately operate, our brand recognition and reputation would suffer, we would incur significant expense establishing new brands and our operating results would be adversely impacted.\n\nThe patents we own in the United States and those that may be issued in the United States, in the UK, in Europe, and in the People's Republic of China in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may never be granted. Even if  issued,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  patents  will  adequately  protect  our  intellectual  property  or  survive  a  legal  challenge,  as  the  legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. Our limited patent protection  may  restrict  our  ability  to  protect  our  technologies  and  processes  from  competition.  We  primarily  rely  on  trade  secret  laws  to  protect  our technologies and processes, including the algorithms we use throughout our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies and processes, or may improperly acquire and use information about our technologies and processes, which may allow them to provide a service similar to ours, which could harm our competitive position.\n\n## We may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\nWe are also at risk of claims by others that we have infringed their copyrights, trademarks, or patents, or improperly used or disclosed their trade secrets. The costs  of  supporting  any  litigation  or  disputes  related  to  these  claims  can  be  considerable,  and  we  cannot  assure  that  we  will  achieve  a  favorable outcome of any such claim. If any such claims are valid, we may be compelled to cease our use of such intellectual property and pay damages, which could adversely affect our business. Even if such claims are not valid, defending them could be expensive and distracting, adversely affecting our operating results.\n\n## Risks Relating to Taxes\n\n## Changes in U.S. tax or tariff policy regarding apparel produced in other countries could adversely affect our business.\n\nA predominant portion of the apparel we sell is originally manufactured in countries other than the United States. International trade disputes that result in tariffs and other protectionist measures could adversely affect our business, including disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our  merchandise  and  increased  uncertainties  in  planning  our  sourcing  strategies  and  forecasting  our  margins.  For  example,  in  recent  years,  the  U.S. government imposed significant new tariffs on China related to the importation of certain product categories, including apparel, footwear, and other goods. A substantial portion of our products are manufactured in China. As a result of these tariffs, our cost of goods imported from China increased slightly. Although we continue to work with our vendors to mitigate our exposure to current or potential tariffs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any increased costs. Other changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships, or tax provisions could also reduce the supply of goods available to us or increase our cost of goods. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt to and manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of such uncertainty, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues, reduce our profitability, and negatively impact our business.\n\n## We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our clients would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results.\n\nIn general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which we do not have a tax nexus, in reliance on court decisions and/or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude the imposition of obligations to collect such taxes with respect to the online sales of our products. In addition, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do have a physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. , that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. All states have now enacted legislation to require sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is still possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability from previous periods for which we did not collect sales, use, or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Federal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNew income or other tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws and regulations could be interpreted, modified, or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'Tax Act') and CARES Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the IRS and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act and CARES Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act and CARES Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. Further regulatory or legislative developments may also arise. We are currently unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, our suppliers or our customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe are  subject  to  income-  and  non-income-based  taxes  in  the  United  States  under  federal,  state,  and  local  jurisdictions.  The  governing  tax  laws  and applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction and are subject to interpretation. Various tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authorities were to successfully challenge one or more of our tax positions, the results could have a material effect on our operating results. Further, the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and\n\nlevel of earnings by taxing jurisdictions, or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. The determination of our overall provision for income and other taxes is inherently uncertain as it requires significant judgment around complex transactions and calculations. As a result, fluctuations in our ultimate tax obligations may differ materially from amounts recorded in our financial statements and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in the periods for which such determination is made.\n\n## Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\nAs of July 29, 2023, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $152.7 million and $274.7 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely; state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2025. The ability to use  our  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  depends  on  the  availability  of  future  taxable  income.  In  addition,  as  of  July  29,  2023,  we  had  federal  and California  research  and  development  tax  credit  carryforwards  of  $49.5  million  and  $23.9  million,  respectively.  The  federal  research  and  development credits  will  begin  to  expire  in  2036,  if  not  utilized;  California  research  and  development  credits  do  not  have  an  expiration  date.  A  portion  of  our  tax attributes are subject to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions, which sets limitations arising from ownership changes. Any potential limitations on our ability to offset future income with our tax attributes could result in increased future tax liability to us.\n\n## Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 actual or anticipated decreases in our client base, the level of client engagement, client acquisition and retention, and revenue and other operating results;\n- \u00b7 variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors, and the financial community;\n- \u00b7 any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information, or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n- \u00b7 actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n- \u00b7 repurchases of our Class A common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, which could also cause our stock price to be higher that it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock;\n- \u00b7 whether investors or securities analysts view our stock structure unfavorably, particularly our dual-class structure and the significant voting control of our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates;\n- \u00b7 additional shares of our Class A common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales;\n- \u00b7 announcements  by  us  or  our  competitors  of  significant  products  or  features,  technical  innovations,  acquisitions,  strategic  partnerships,  joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n- \u00b7 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our vendors and competitors;\n- \u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n- \u00b7 targeted efforts of social media or other groups to transact in and affect the price of Stitch Fix stock, such as the activity in early 2021 targeting GameStop Corp and others;\n- \u00b7 lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n- \u00b7 developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n- \u00b7 other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or responses to these events.\n\nIn  addition,  extreme  price  and  volume  fluctuations  in  the  stock  markets  have  affected  and  continue  to  affect  many  eCommerce  and  other  technology companies' stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies' operating performance. In the past,  stockholders  have  filed  securities  class  action  litigation  following  periods  of  market  volatility.  For  example,  beginning  in  October  2018,  we  and certain of our directors and officers were sued in putative class action and derivative lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements. And on August 26, 2022, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws was filed by  certain  of  our  stockholders  naming  as  defendants  us,  certain  of  our  officers  and  directors  for  allegedly  making  materially  false  and  misleading statements regarding our Freestyle offering. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well. Such securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and seriously harm our business.\n\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\n\n## We  cannot  guarantee  that  our  share  repurchase  program  will  be  fully  consummated  or  that  it  will  enhance  long-term  stockholder  value.  Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\n\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock, with no expiration date. During fiscal 2023 and the three and nine months ended April 27, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock,  and  we  had  $120.0  million  remaining  in  share  repurchase  capacity  as  of  April  27,  2024.  Although  our  Board  of  Directors  has  authorized  this repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The actual timing  and  amount  of  repurchases  remain  subject  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including  stock  price,  trading  volume,  market  conditions  and  other  general business considerations. In addition, the terms of our first lien credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as agent and lender ('the 2023 Credit Facility'), impose limitations on our ability to repurchase shares. The share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time, and we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program could diminish our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\n## Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, then the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of Class A and Class B common stock subject to stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and reserved for issuance under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2017 Incentive Plan, and our 2019 Inducement Plan (collectively, our 'Incentive Plans') have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\n## The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, the holders of our Class B common stock,  including  certain  of  our  directors,  executive  officers,  and  their  affiliates,  are  able  to  exercise  considerable  influence  over  matters  requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. As of May 29, 2024, 26,355,097 of our 122,340,710 shares outstanding were held by our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, and 22,483,932 of such shares held by our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates were shares of Class B common stock. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may cause us to make strategic decisions that could involve risks to you or that may not be aligned with your interests. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard &amp; Poor's announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P MidCap 400, and S&amp;P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&amp;P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure currently makes us ineligible for inclusion in Standard &amp; Poor's indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track the S&amp;P indices  will  not  be  investing  in  our  stock.  It  is  unclear  what  effect,  if  any,  these  policies  have  had  or  may  have  on  the  valuations  of  publicly  traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that  they  may  depress  these  valuations  compared  to  those  of  other  similar  companies  that  are included.\n\n## We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation of the value of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe  have  never  declared  or  paid  cash  dividends  on  our  capital  stock.  We  currently  intend  to  retain  any  future  earnings  to  finance  the  operation  and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, any investment return our Class A common stock will depend upon increases in the value for our Class A common stock, which is not certain.\n\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our Company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n- \u00b7 permit the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n- \u00b7 provide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n- \u00b7 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n- \u00b7 authorize the issuance of 'blank check' preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n- \u00b7 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n- \u00b7 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n- \u00b7 provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws;\n- \u00b7 restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n- \u00b7 reflect the dual class structure of our common stock; and\n- \u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\n\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\n- \u00b7 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n- \u00b7 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\n- \u00b7 any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n- \u00b7 any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\n\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\n\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\n## Future securities sales and issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe may issue additional equity securities in the future. We also issue awards for Class A common stock to our existing and new employees and others under our Incentive Plans. The number of shares subject to such awards is typically based on target dollar values, and therefore the number of shares increases as our stock price decreases. Future issuances of shares of our Class A common stock or the conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, or the perception that these sales or conversions may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in dilution to existing holders of our Class A common stock. Also, to the extent outstanding options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock are exercised or options or other stock-based awards are issued or become vested, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution  could  be  substantial  depending  upon  the  size  of  the  issuances  or  exercises  and  our  stock  price.  Furthermore,  we  may  issue  additional  equity securities that could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock bear the risk that future issuances of debt or equity securities may reduce the value of our Class A common stock and further dilute their ownership interest.\n\n## If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our reported financial information and this may lead to a decline in our stock price.\n\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the 'Sarbanes-Oxley Act'). Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. We have experienced material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls previously. Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 29, 2023. However, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal  deficiencies  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  are  deemed  to  be  material  weaknesses.  If  we  or  our  accounting  firm  identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, it could harm our operating results, adversely affect our reputation, or result in inaccurate financial reporting. Furthermore, should any such deficiencies arise we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including SEC enforcement actions and we could be required to restate our financial results, any of which would require additional financial and management resources.\n\nEven if we do not detect deficiencies, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud, and individuals, including employees and contractors, could circumvent such controls. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\n\nIn  addition,  we  may  encounter  difficulties  in  the  timely  and  accurate  reporting  of  our  financial  results,  which  would  impact  our  ability  to  provide  our investors with information in a timely manner. Should we encounter such difficulties, our investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial information and trading price of our Class A common stock. could be negatively impacted.\n\n## We may not be able to generate sufficient capital to support and grow our business, and outside capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.\n\nWe require sufficient cash and liquidity to run our business, finance our operations, and pay for capital expenditures. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund our working capital and capital expenditures needs. We also may require additional funds to support growth or respond to business challenges. We are party to a credit agreement with Citibank, N.A. but a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality of our earnings could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants, which would limit our ability to utilize our credit facility.\n\nWe also may want or need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. The capital market environment, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, or interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict access to a potential source of liquidity. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur 2023 Credit Facility also contains covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions, and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum liquidity level and a minimum total consolidated fixed charge coverage Ratio above specified levels, measured in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The restrictive covenants of this or any future debt financing secured may make it more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  capital  and  to  pursue  business  opportunities.  Any  debt  financing  secured  by  us  in  the  future  could  involve  restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient capital or obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support  our  business  and  to  respond  to  business  challenges  could  be  significantly  limited,  and  our  business  and  prospects  could  fail  or  be  adversely affected.\n\n## If securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline.
